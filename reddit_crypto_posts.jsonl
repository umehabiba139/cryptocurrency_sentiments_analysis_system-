Bitcoin belief in 3 cycles.", "selftext": "For me, it took about 3 cycles to get to a place where I fully believe in bitcoin and will hodl it until my kids need to go to college / need a house, or big life events require me to sell.  I'm wondering if many other people experienced the same timeline...?\n\nMy first cycle was the $1k -> $19k cycle.  I knew about bitcoin, some people I knew gambled in bitcoin or used it for various activities, but I personally didn't get it.  I saw my house and stocks go up in value and that was good enough to me.  I saw bitcoin as speculative and something that government could make illegal at any minute so I didn't bother.  Saw it go up to nearly $20k, and had a little regret but that quickly faded as I saw bitcoin 'crash' back to the $3-6k region, and didn't really think about it again.\n\nMy second cycle, I bought 1 bitcoin around $6k just to diversify from my home that gained equity and some stocks I had (I also sold TSLA at $17 and APPL super early which is another time for a regret story).  Bitcoin got to about $35k and I sold figuring that bitcoin would again crash and that FTX and all that stuff would destroy bitcoin (all the paper bitcoin talk, etc, etc).  So I sold, watching bitcoin go up to $69k but then sure enough crashing to $16k ish.\n\nBut then something happened, and I got orange pilled.  I read more about the technology, and read many books, not only on bitcoin, but also on the histories of fiat.  I realized that yes, FTX crashed, but it didn't destroy bitcoin, in fact, I think that whole event made bitcoin stronger.  It showed that the weak and the liars will all get called out in the end and bitcoin will survive on because it's unbreakable and constantly audited.  Bitcoin is truth money and it's the ONLY truth money that exists today.  So I get it, and I feel so lucky that I got into it before wall street was able to get the ETFs passed and for once in my life, I really understand something.\n\nI'm now a forever HODLer, I run a node, and I know what truth really is.

No nuke.**\n\nWe made it past June and September with no meaningful sell.\n\n**2. 110k BTC**\n\n110k BTC has solidified even more as an important level which was noted to watch in the prior post. Could even say it's now a support level though it remains to be seen whether bulls can lift prices into meaningful new highs.\n\n**3. No new bull trend**\n\nIt previously seemed really unlikely crypto would enter a new bull trend. But we also didn't get much in the selloff area.\n\n**What to watch for going forward?**\n\n**1. 2026 Jan-Feb Nuke?**\n\nNext area to watch for a nuke. There's a reason nukes have happened so many times in these months in prior years, it has to do with very complicated stock market dynamics. Remember crypto is secondary to the stock market, it follows stocks and specifically tech. /NQ or Nasdaq futures is still a solid indicator to watch for this.\n\n**2. Economy hasn't improved, continues to get worse.**\n\nNo secret that things continue to worsen. Basically only upper middle class and above holding the economy together while lower classes are in a recession. Think you all know the numbers are bad and continue to trend downwards.\n\n**3. 2025 Q4**\n\nNo meaningful sell by this point often leads to a slow grind up into new years. Will we see new highs? Seems more likely than not. Particularly for stocks which should precipitate into crypto. Now will it be a new bull run with repeating new highs in short time periods? I'm skeptical of that but difficult to say either way. There is risk to the upside in stock markets, interest in higher numbers or rather a more bullish quarter is undervalued. This doesn't always precipitate into crypto however. Q4 2021 into Q1 2022 is a good reference for what I mean here. We got a pop early in that ending year quarter but it struggled after with BTC struggling heavily with early heavy sells.\n\nImportant item to reread from last post.\n\n>Nonetheless for a bullish bet, you'd wanna watch for BTC to translate the 110k price level from a resistance level to a support level. Meaning BTC resists dropping below 110k, dips below are bought and price continues to higher highs. This would occur over weeks to months. A handful of breaks above 110k with retreats below isn't bullish, it's bearish. I personally am not betting on a new crypto bull run anytime soon.\n\n\n\nThis is still true as we move through 2025 Q4 into the new year. Failure to achieve new meaningful highs isn't a bullish sign. With the inverse, continued new highs is a bullish sign.\n\n2026 Jan and Feb is dangerous. Whatever happens during Q4 2025, be prepared for 2026.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l8rsbql1ossf1.png?width=1762&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbfca7e199ec0497546a3889fd5b84fbc619085b", "created_utc": 1759453553.0, "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "score": 0, "num_comments": 7, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nwllv3/q4_2025_update_always_remember_we_aint_sheep_we/"}

That is where Ethereum has been: dismissed, doubted and even mocked. Adriano argues that the tide is turning and Ethereum is moving to its 'genius phase.'\n\nThe time is on point because institutions are locking up millions of ETH in reserves, governments are experimenting with Ethereum for settlement systems and developers are still building tools that unlock new things for the chain. The same people who said Ethereum is overhyped have to deal with the reality that it is quietly becoming the foundation for a new financial layer. Adriano formulates it in terms of more than price action, he calls this the emergence of the 'internet of finance,' a system where value moves as freely as information moved on the early internet. If he is right then the next few years are more than about increasing the price, they are about one of history's largest transfers of wealth.\n\nEthereum's 'idiot phase' might have been painful for believers but if this is the 'genius phase' the story has only begun!!\n\n*Source: https://x.com/AdrianoFeria/status/1973392676335604090*", "created_utc": 1759400769.0, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "score": 89, "num_comments": 39, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nw01jr/ethereum_moves_from_idiot_phase_to_genius_phase/"}

The Strategic ETH Reserve (SER) bought 3.9 million ETH in only about 2.5 months, this is a complete removal of that issuance. Ethereum community member Etheraider noted this in a tweet that is making us rethink where demand is genuinely coming from. You see.. this is not retail hype, if you take a look at data from [StrategicETHReserve.xyz](http://StrategicETHReserve.xyz) it shows that public institutions now hold over 5.49 million ETH, or around 4.54% of supply, valued at over $23 billion. Institutions like BitMine are accumulating ETH treasuries in billions, this tells us we are seeing a structural trend. If this continues at this pace it is possible that the price reaches more than $10,000.\n\nThe 'ultrasound money' story, once about deflation and EIP-1559 burns, has changed now. After the 2024 Dencun upgrade ETH's supply inflates at a rate of approximately 0.74% each year. Yet the chain's role as a settlement layer still makes it an attractive reserve asset. Institutions are not betting on meme burns and fake hype, they are betting on Ethereum's neutrality and security. So when 4 years of issuance gets tied up in just 2/3 months, it is not only bullish but also a sign. The biggest players are holding ETH less like a trade and more like a foundation.\n\n*Source:* [*https://x.com/etheraider/status/1972728043904102795*](https://x.com/etheraider/status/1972728043904102795)", "created_utc": 1759320974.0, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "score": 93, "num_comments": 20, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nv6kpm/strategic_eth_reserve_buys_4_years_of_ethereum/"}

First: involve small stakers and retail ETH holders in governance. Second: make the protocol resist external pressure with tools that preserve privacy, this makes corporate control impossible.

The final Yes that can not be undone.\n\nI see Ethereum as a massive global financial hub like Leon does too.\n\n* The main chain (L1) is like the central bank and court system, it sets the rules and records the most critical operations keeping them safe.\n* Layer 2s are booming cities connected by highways and processing huge amounts of commerce but always reporting back to the center.\n* EVM-compatible chains? They are neighboring nations, independent but still tied together by culture, infrastructure and shared technology.\n\nEven with new competitors rising, most important value still flows through Ethereum ecosystem and it keeps growing. ETH is the heart of all of it, the fuel, the currency and the trust layer that keeps the machine running.\n\n# \ud83c\udd74\ud83c\udd83\ud83c\udd77\ud83c\udd74\ud83c\udd81\ud83c\udd74\ud83c\udd84\ud83c\udd7c \ud83c\udd78\ud83c\udd82 \ud83c\udd83\ud83c\udd77\ud83c\udd74 \ud83c\udd75\ud83c\udd84\ud83c\udd83\ud83c\udd84\ud83c\udd81\ud83c\udd74 \ud83c\udd7e\ud83c\udd75 \ud83c\udd75\ud83c\udd78\ud83c\udd7d\ud83c\udd70\ud83c\udd7d\ud83c\udd72\ud83c\udd74\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1972667969785225709](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1972667969785225709)", "created_utc": 1759213078.0, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "score": 135, "num_comments": 68, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nu5om5/ethereum_isnt_just_surviving_its_still_the/"}

{"id": "1ntvcxy", "title": "Crypto Education - A Deep Dive into Neptune Cash", "selftext": "So for those who have been on this sub for the last 2 weeks, you've seen Neptune Cash as they've been featured in the Community Spotlight and did an AMA a couple weeks ago.\n\nAs a big privacy advocate, this obviously caught my attention and I wanted to DMOR on the project, play around, and see what it was about. I've spent some time exploring their docs, blogs, and setup. \n\nTL;DR - It's a Layer-1 project focused on privacy and post-quantum security. It's still early, but very reminiscent of other privacy coins that started out with limited buzz but interesting innovation. \n\n# What Neptune Cash Is All About\n\nAt its core, Neptune Cash is a peer-to-peer anonymous cash protocol built as a Layer-1 blockchain. It uses zk-STARKs integrated right at the base layer, which means users handle transaction proofs on their end, miners aggregate everything into one big block with a single proof. This keeps the chain succinct and scalable without bloating.\n\nThe standout for me is the privacy aspect. Transactions are fully anonymous by default, using mutator sets (a fresh approach to zero-knowledge that maintains privacy with full verifiability). It's designed for fungible cash-like transfers, and it also supports private smart contracts with arbitrary logic. This means it can be used in DeFi or apps and your portfolio stays hidden. \n\nCompared to something like Monero, which relies on ring signatures, this setup feels more efficient for scaling while keeping things untraceable. A\n\nFor post-quantum security, it is baked in from the start. All the cryptography is resistant to quantum attacks, meaning future upgrades or risks of a supply shock if quantum computers advance stay off the table. Neptune is quantum-secure at genesis, which is different than other projects where they would fix the quantum problem through forking the chain with the patch upgrades. This approach which positions Neptune for long-term usage in a world where privacy tech faces bigger threats down the line.\n\n# The Team Behind It\n\nAlan Szepieniec serves as the lead researcher. He holds a PhD in post-quantum cryptography from the University of Leuven in Belgium, works as a researcher at the Nervos Foundation, and founded AS Discrete Mathematics GmbH in Zug, Switzerland. He has authored numerous scientific papers, with key contributions including DARK/Supersonic (SNARKs without trusted setups using novel mathematics) and Rescue & Rescue-Prime (hash functions widely adopted for zero-knowledge proofs). \n\nThorkil V\u00e6rge is the other founder. He holds an MSc in Physics from the University of Copenhagen and brings over seven years of experience in blockchain technology. He has contributed to the specifications of the Ethereum protocol and the Bitcoin Lightning Network, built core blockchain implementations for companies like BitGo, Bitcoin Suisse, and Inacta, and created a compiler for specifying financial contracts on Ethereum.\n\nSuper a research-heavy team, with the project representing five years of dedicated R&D. This project took a long time to ship, but personally, I appreciate the dedication to solid technical achievements.\n\n# Tokenomics and Mechanics\n\nToken is $NPT, with a total supply capped at 42 million \u2013 similar to Bitcoin's model but with tweaks. Halvings every three years, starting from 128 per block. Half of mining rewards are locked for three years, which aligns miners with long-term holding rather than quick actions. Premine is under 2%, and the design is deflationary over time.\n\nMining is Proof-of-Work, but memory-hard (needs about 40GB RAM for efficiency), which levels the field against botnets and ASICs. It got hit by a botnet early on (common issue for PoW chains), leading to a relaunch in August 2025 with the upgraded algo. Now it's more decentralized and resistant. If you're into mining, it's CPU/GPU friendly. The adoption is low and growing organically, like early privacy coins where miners were the first users.\n\n# Ways to participate\n\nAfter the AMA, I set up a node and wallet to poke around. Here's the practical side:\n\n* Wallet and Node: Download the core software from their GitHub (neptune-core). It's CLI-based for now \u2013 run commands to generate a wallet and sync the chain. Syncing is fast thanks to the recursive proofs; validating the whole history is basically instant.\n* Mining: If you want to try, install the core, configure your wallet, and point it at a pool or solo mine. Their docs cover it \u2013 it's straightforward if you're used to PoW setups. Usage is still early, but contributors are popping up because the tech is appealing for privacy-focused builds.\n* Acquiring $NPT: Only on SafeTrade right now (NPT-USDT pair). Liquidity is thin, so limit orders are key to avoid slippage. DEX is on the roadmap.\n* Resources: YouTube is great for explainers & the explorer lets you view blocks without revealing privacy details.\n\nFrom what I've seen, adoption is in that bootstrapping phase. Usage starting with miners and devs but showing a lot of promise. Privacy and future-proofing are the core strengths, and it's worth exploring. I've learned a ton just setting it up.

In a recent tweet gphummer.eth from Etherealize explained 'credible neutrality' as Ethereum's strongest feature. The idea is that no matter your politics, Democrat, Republican, Anarchist or Bureaucrat, Ethereum treats you equally. Your code runs, your property stays safe and above all no one can censor you.\n\nThis matters now more than ever. Big institutions are starting to take Ethereum seriously. Just last week ChinaAMC launched an Ethereum-based product showing confidence in Ethereum's fairness and with Ethereum playing a role in Hong Kong's e-HKD pilot program, we are seeing governments test its use for real-world payments. The roots of this idea go way back as early as 2014, Vitalik described the need for systems that resist centralized control. Even James Madison's Federalist Papers checks-and-balances system is following the same principle: limit power, avoid dependency on middlemen. That is what Ethereum's validator network does today.\n\nIn his tweet gphummer claimed that 'in 20 years, the entire planet will run on Ethereum.' However if you take a minute to think about it, if the world needs neutrality then gphummer is not that far off. Ethereum does not bend to power or profit.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/gphummer/status/1972144955851526512*", "created_utc": 1759146322.0, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "score": 56, "num_comments": 29, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ntfs3b/why_ethereums_credible_neutrality_makes_it_the/"}

That kind of climb tends to stick better than a straight-line spike. If we start closing days above 4.5k and treating 4.2\u20134.3k as a buyable dip, my base case shifts from \u201crange with wicks\u201d to \u201ctrend with shallow pullbacks.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not leaning on patterns alone. The checklist I care about is spot > futures, funding and basis staying reasonable, and dips getting absorbed without cascading liquidations. If we see that, the path to retesting prior highs isn\u2019t fantasy. If, instead, we get perma-positive funding and a wide futures premium while spot flows fade, that\u2019s a caution flag.\n\nOn chain, I\u2019m watching the boring plumbing: L2 activity and fees trending up but not choking, stablecoin velocity actually used in DeFi vs just sitting, and staking flows remaining steady. None of these are moon signals by themselves, but together they separate healthy momentum from froth.\n\nWhat would invalidate the bull read for me? A weekly close back below 4.0\u20134.1k with rising open interest and heavy long skew would look like trapped chase longs. In that case, it\u2019s back to range until proven otherwise.\n\nMy plan is simple: let price prove it above 4.5k on closes, size positions so a normal pullback doesn\u2019t wreck the thesis, and avoid chasing candles on headline days.

The Strategic ETH Reserve (SER) bought 3.9 million ETH in only about 2.5 months, this is a complete removal of that issuance. Ethereum community member Etheraider noted this in a tweet that is making us rethink where demand is genuinely coming from. You see.. this is not retail hype, if you take a look at data from [StrategicETHReserve.xyz](http://StrategicETHReserve.xyz) it shows that public institutions now hold over 5.49 million ETH, or around 4.54% of supply, valued at over $23 billion. Institutions like BitMine are accumulating ETH treasuries in billions, this tells us we are seeing a structural trend. If this continues at this pace it is possible that the price reaches more than $10,000.\n\nThe 'ultrasound money' story, once about deflation and EIP-1559 burns, has changed now. After the 2024 Dencun upgrade ETH's supply inflates at a rate of approximately 0.74% each year. Yet the chain's role as a settlement layer still makes it an attractive reserve asset. Institutions are not betting on meme burns and fake hype, they are betting on Ethereum's neutrality and security. So when 4 years of issuance gets tied up in just 2/3 months, it is not only bullish but also a sign. The biggest players are holding ETH less like a trade and more like a foundation.\n\n*Source:* [*https://x.com/etheraider/status/1972728043904102795*](https://x.com/etheraider/status/1972728043904102795)", "created_utc": 1759320974.0, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "score": 94, "num_comments": 20, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nv6kpm/strategic_eth_reserve_buys_4_years_of_ethereum/"}

Makes sense: you smooth volatility and remove emotion.\n\nExecution is the interesting part. Most people use Coinbase or Kraken recurring buys...simple, but fees/spreads can add up. I\u2019ve been using Jupiter on Solana for on-chain DCA: set an interval and it routes across DEXs for best price. Way more flexible than most CEX options. Downside: you need to manage SOL for gas and on-chain failures/alerts.\n\nTax reality (US): buying crypto with fiat is not a taxable event. Weekly DCA creates lots of purchases to track for basis, but you don\u2019t have a taxable event until you dispose (sell/trade/spend). On-chain, the gas you pay in SOL is a small taxable disposal of that SOL at its FMV when paid. That\u2019s minor per tx, but real.\n\nBecause DCA multiplies transactions, crypto tax software isn\u2019t optional once volume rises. You\u2019ll want clean lot tracking (Specific ID/HIFO if you can substantiate, otherwise FIFO), fee roll-in to basis, and exports that won\u2019t wreck your 8949 when you eventually sell.\n\nawaken.tax pulls your CEX and wallets, links internal transfers, applies your chosen lot method, and produces clean Form 8949 exports so your DCA doesn\u2019t turn into spreadsheet purgatory at filing time.\n\nMy current setup: weekly BTC/ETH buys, bi-weekly SOL via Jupiter for alts. Took ~30 minutes to configure; then it runs.\n\nAnyone else running DCA? What cadence are you using, and are you staying on CEX for simplicity or going on-chain for flexibility?

Many people on this subreddit have complained about Ethereum's institutional adoption, arguing for exactly what is written here.\n\nGoing back to the tweet pcaversaccio did not just criticize things, he also showed how to resist. First: involve small stakers and retail ETH holders in governance. Second: make the protocol resist external pressure with tools that preserve privacy, this makes corporate control impossible. And third: reward and incentivize builders and users who keep cypherpunk values.\n\nThis is a contrast to the news around ETF's, government pilots and banks testing Ethereum.

They are neighboring nations, independent but still tied together by culture, infrastructure and shared technology.\n\nEven with new competitors rising, most important value still flows through Ethereum ecosystem and it keeps growing.

The technical setup is pretty interesting right now.\n\nOn the daily chart, we pulled back into a support confluence at $3.8K. That's where the 100-day moving average meets the ascending channel's lower boundary. We're still above the 200-day MA which is bullish longer term.\n\nThe rejection from $4,600-$4,700 created short term downside pressure. But as long as we hold above $3.8K-$3.9K, there's room for recovery. A sustained daily close back above that order block would likely trigger bullish momentum.\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows ETH dropped into the $3,800-$3,900 demand zone and bounced quickly. We're testing $4,200 resistance right now. Above this, $4,300-$4,400 is the next critical resistance level.\n\nIf we fail to reclaim momentum above $4,200, we might consolidate or retest $3,800 support again. But a clean breakout would open the path to revisit $4,600-$4,700.\n\nThe liquidation heatmap is interesting. The recent decline triggered a long squeeze that wiped out overleveraged positions below $3,900 before the bounce.\n\nRight now there's a dense liquidity cluster at $4,200. It's both a hurdle and a magnet for price. If ETH breaks above and clears that liquidity, the next major concentration is above $4,700 at the swing highs.\n\nMarket tends to move toward these liquidity pools. So while buyers need to absorb supply at $4,200 first, the larger liquidity above $4,700 suggests the path of least resistance is tilted upward.\n\nBulls need to defend $3.9K to keep the uptrend intact. Reclaiming $4.2K would confirm continuation toward previous highs.\n\nAnyone else watching these levels?

The idea is that no matter your politics, Democrat, Republican, Anarchist or Bureaucrat, Ethereum treats you equally. Your code runs, your property stays safe and above all no one can censor you.\n\nThis matters now more than ever. Big institutions are starting to take Ethereum seriously. Just last week ChinaAMC launched an Ethereum-based product showing confidence in Ethereum's fairness and with Ethereum playing a role in Hong Kong's e-HKD pilot program, we are seeing governments test its use for real-world payments. The roots of this idea go way back as early as 2014, Vitalik described the need for systems that resist centralized control. Even James Madison's Federalist Papers checks-and-balances system is following the same principle: limit power, avoid dependency on middlemen. That is what Ethereum's validator network does today.\n\nIn his tweet gphummer claimed that 'in 20 years, the entire planet will run on Ethereum.' However if you take a minute to think about it, if the world needs neutrality then gphummer is not that far off.

They're represented by mintable NFTs that come with exclusive perks for subscribers.\n\nUntil now, memberships followed a seasonal model. Each season lasted 2 months and came with a unique, tradable NFT.\n\n---\n\n## The change\n\n**After a discussion between the Donut DAO developers, we decided to sunset the seasonal model. The reason is it was unsustainable because of the ongoing maintenance it requires.**\n\nWhen a developer gets busy IRL, parts of the system (like updating prices or frontend displays) can become temporarily unavailable, creating a negative user experience.\n\n**To solve this, we're moving back to the traditional monthly subscription model, the same type originally offered when memberships were supported by Reddit.**\n\nWe deployed a perpetual contract that automatically updates subscription prices without manual maintenance. This will give everyone a much smoother and more reliable experience.\n\n---\n\n## Important notes\n\n* Each membership now lasts 30 days.\n* The price is now $5 in DONUT.\n* Subscriptions do not stack. If you buy 2 memberships, that's 30 days each, not 60.\n* Memberships are only available on Arbitrum One.\n* The price, in DONUT, changes with market activity. Example: if it costs 1,000 DONUT to mint a new card, a trade might increase the price to 1,150 right after. Be sure your wallet allowance covers these small changes.\n* Subscribers will have the same exclusive subreddit privileges as before.\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**What are r/EthTrader Special Memberships?**\n\nSpecial Memberships are monthly subscriptions represented by tradable NFT \"cards\" that offer different perks to subscribers within the r/EthTrader subreddit.

{"id": "1nsilla", "title": "Tokenized RWAs coming to Ethereum \u2014 worth paying attention?", "selftext": "One of the strongest narratives in crypto right now is tokenization of real world assets. We have already seen treasuries, private credit, and real estate enter the space, and now even commodities like uranium are being tokenized and made available in fractional amounts. The idea is simple: take assets that are normally restricted to institutions with high entry barriers and turn them into tokens that trade 24/7 on-chain.\n\nEthereum has emerged as the primary settlement layer for most RWA initiatives. Institutions trust its security, its liquidity, and the depth of tooling available across DeFi. Even when projects issue wrapped versions on other chains, Ethereum usually sits at the base for custody and settlement. For many, this could be the bridge that finally connects traditional capital markets with crypto in a meaningful way.\n\nSupporters argue that tokenized RWAs can unlock trillions in value, create new forms of collateral, and drive sustainable yield opportunities that go beyond speculative farming. Critics are more cautious, pointing to unresolved challenges around custody, regulatory compliance, and reliable proof of reserves. The debate often comes down to whether this is truly decentralized finance or simply a new wrapper for the existing system.\n\nAs traders, the big question is whether tokenized RWAs can be a real growth driver for Ethereum and its ecosystem. Is this a fundamental shift that strengthens ETH\u2019s position as the settlement layer for global assets, or just another passing narrative cycle?", "created_utc": 1759046164.0, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "score": 12, "num_comments": 14, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nsilla/tokenized_rwas_coming_to_ethereum_worth_paying/"}

Well according to the results 93% of Solana supply went straight to insiders and the foundation. Now compare that to Ethereum that only kept less than 10% for 'insiders' and sold almost half in a public sale. That contrast tells us something, the launch of Ethereum in 2015 was messy, slow and public. Anybody could have bought.. and thousands did. That open culture is what gave Ethereum its big base of developers and owners. The distribution of Solana looks a lot closer to a venture-funded startup where insiders hold the keys.\n\nSo there is a problem here because such a supply structure creates risks of manipulation, big sell-offs and weak community trust. It also makes Solana less permissionless and more like what rip.eth called an 'insider-traded memecoin.' The strength of Ethereum has never been centralized leadership. Ethereum is a billion-dollar ecosystem thanks to outsiders, not insiders and not due to insiders pulling strings. The base layer belongs to those who actually use it, that is the real foundation of decentralization and the reason why Ethereum continues to dominate and still sets the standard.\n\n*Source:* [*https://x.com/ripdoteth/status/1970851162141454692*](https://x.com/ripdoteth/status/1970851162141454692)", "created_utc": 1758971497.0, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "score": 63, "num_comments": 31, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nrsjza/ethereum_and_solana_who_really_owns_the_network/"}

Bitcoin makes massive leaps and suddenly tons of people who do not have much knowledge about the topic decide to set up a node, because they heard it protects the network and thus their money. For the sake of the question let's imagine 60.000 people all download the same node software from the at this point dominant developing team. So the new node operators make up more than half of all node operators and thet all run the same software.\n\nOne day, someone with malicious intent gains control over the development team and makes an update which raises the maximum of available Bitcoin to 100 million coins. All 60.000 new node operators who don't know shit about fuck install the new update without reading anything about it. Because you got to get the new version of a software, right?

{"id": "1nxnlcb", "title": "If This Is the Bull Market, Then Altcoins Are Finished", "selftext": "This cycle feels completely off for anyone who isn\u2019t holding Bitcoin.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about meme coins or the latest #1832 CMC gem promoted by a YouTube gambler. I mean the supposed blue chips. The serious, established projects that actually built, shipped, and survived.\n\n**Here\u2019s where things stand (approx. numbers):**\n\n* **ADA** peaked around **$2.90**, now sits near **$0.85**, about 70% down.\n* **LINK** has improved but is still roughly 50\u201360% below its ATH. Market CAP close to ATH (sh\\*t tokenomics?)\n* **DOT** peaked near **$55**, now **$4.29**, over 90% drop.\n* **AAVE** has recovered somewhat but still trades at roughly half its ATH.\n* **ALGO** has been bleeding for two years with no clear bottom in sight.\n\nThese are not vaporware projects. They have real ecosystems, partnerships, and communities. Yet the market refuses to reward them. Even after two years of recovery, they are still deep in red territory.\n\n**Now let's look at Ethereum.**\n\nETH should be leading this cycle. Instead, it is just hovering around its previous ATH. At this stage, ETH should be in clear price discovery, not struggling to hold ground.\n\nEvery other week someone posts about \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cinstitutional demand.\u201d Charts showing exchange reserves collapsing from 16 million to 9 million ETH. Every previous time this happened, a massive rally followed.\n\n**This time, nothing.**\n\nSo where is the rally? Where is the institutional bid that was supposed to push ETH into a new era? If this is the cycle top, then something is broken.\n\n**And where is retail?**\n\nYes, we know the global economy is weak. The US economy is shaky, inflation is sticky, interest rates are high, the job market is rolling over, and retail investors have been burned too many times. People are tired. They remember Terra, Celsius, FTX, and every other implosion that wiped out savings. They learned their lesson. They are sitting out, holding cash, or chasing AI stocks instead (the new crypto get rich quick scheme).\n\nBut if the \u201csmart money\u201d and the \u201csupply shock\u201d narratives are both real, why is price action this lifeless?  Where is the demand that\u2019s supposed to absorb the drained supply?\n\n**But that\u2019s not the whole story.**\n\nBecause the truth is, money is flowing. Just not here.\n\nThe S&P 500, Nasdaq, and even gold are at or near all-time highs. Liquidity is alive and well. Capital hasn\u2019t disappeared. It\u2019s simply choosing not to touch altcoins. Institutions are back in equities and Bitcoin. Retail is speculating on Nvidia instead of LINK or DOT. The excuse that \u201cthe macro environment is too tough\u201d doesn\u2019t hold when traditional markets are booming and Bitcoin is making new highs. The problem isn\u2019t (only) the economy, it\u2019s demand for alts.\n\n**Old playbook: dead?**\n\nMaybe the uncomfortable reality is that the old playbook no longer works. The traditional rotation pattern of BTC pumping first, ETH following, and alts going parabolic appears to be finished. Capital now stops at Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sometimes it touches Solana and a few new narratives. A big part of liquidity in crypto is also spread thin across thousands of useless projects that still somehow trade daily. That\u2019s it.\n\nIf even Ethereum, with its ETF narrative, deflationary supply, and \u201cinstitutional adoption\u201d story, cannot decisively break its previous highs, what chance do the others have?\n\nIf ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, and ALGO fail to reach their previous peaks in this environment, they will not recover in the next one. The next bear market will bury them for good.\n\nThis may be the first cycle where altcoin believers realize that not every \u201cstrong project\u201d will come back. Bitcoin and a handful of layer-1s will survive. The rest will quietly fade away.\n\nMaybe alt season is not delayed. Maybe it didn\u2019t ever start. Maybe it ended already four years ago?\n\nAnd maybe this cycle is the moment when everyone finally looks around and says, \u201cIs this really it?\u201d\n\nIf ETH and alts don\u2019t pick up by the end of the year, the entire crypto market faces two possible outcomes:\n\n1. **Most Altcoins collapse completely in the next bear market.** Retail won\u2019t come back. Total market liquidity shrinks. The old pattern of alt buyers eventually converting into long-term Bitcoin holders disappears. Even Bitcoin takes a hit, because as much as people like to pretend otherwise, institutions still need retail to dump on.\n2. **Everyone simply buys Bitcoin next time.** Retail and institutions both pile into BTC, ignoring altcoins altogether. One-off alts will still rise, but mostly not. Bitcoin becomes the only real trade left. But this is less likely, since the main appeal of altcoins has always been their higher risk-to-reward upside.\n\nEither way, if nothing changes soon, crypto\u2019s future may be far more narrow than most people think.\n\n**TL;DR** Blue-chip alts like ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, ALGO, and even ETH are still far below their 2021 highs. Retail is gone, institutions are all talk, and the classic \u201cBTC -> ETH -> alts\u201d rotation seems dead. If ETH and alts don\u2019t move by year-end, the next bear could wipe out most of the alt market for good, leaving only Bitcoin and a few survivors.", "created_utc": 1759562912.0, "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "score": 269, "num_comments": 293, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nxnlcb/if_this_is_the_bull_market_then_altcoins_are/"}

But now that I've exhausted that, I do not see any reason to use Swan over Strike for DCA purchases. Swan also added an AUM fee for keeping BTC with them and I don't like to withdraw to wallet too often. This really made me disfavor Swan. Plus, Swan charges a 1% fee for any purchase.\n\nAlternatively, Strike has no fees for recurring purchases after a set amount of times doing it, free withdrawals (if you're willing to wait as much as 24 hours), and no AUM fee. Plus the mobile app UI is better imo. I have since switched to Strike. Is there any reason I should stick with Swan? It seems Strike is the superior option. Does Strike have a larger spread I am not considering or anything?\n\nFor buying dips and random purchases when I have extra funds, I think Kraken+ is the way to go. Only $4.99 a month and no trading fees up to $10,000/month. If these kinds of buys are more than $500/month, Kraken+ seems to offer a good deal. Any thoughts on this?

{"id": "1nxnlcb", "title": "If This Is the Bull Market, Then Altcoins Are Finished", "selftext": "This cycle feels completely off for anyone who isn\u2019t holding Bitcoin.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about meme coins or the latest #1832 CMC gem promoted by a YouTube gambler. I mean the supposed blue chips. The serious, established projects that actually built, shipped, and survived.\n\n**Here\u2019s where things stand (approx. numbers):**\n\n* **ADA** peaked around **$2.90**, now sits near **$0.85**, about 70% down.\n* **LINK** has improved but is still roughly 50\u201360% below its ATH. Market CAP close to ATH (sh\\*t tokenomics?)\n* **DOT** peaked near **$55**, now **$4.29**, over 90% drop.\n* **AAVE** has recovered somewhat but still trades at roughly half its ATH.\n* **ALGO** has been bleeding for two years with no clear bottom in sight.\n\nThese are not vaporware projects. They have real ecosystems, partnerships, and communities. Yet the market refuses to reward them. Even after two years of recovery, they are still deep in red territory.\n\n**Now let's look at Ethereum.**\n\nETH should be leading this cycle. Instead, it is just hovering around its previous ATH. At this stage, ETH should be in clear price discovery, not struggling to hold ground.\n\nEvery other week someone posts about \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cinstitutional demand.\u201d Charts showing exchange reserves collapsing from 16 million to 9 million ETH. Every previous time this happened, a massive rally followed.\n\n**This time, nothing.**\n\nSo where is the rally? Where is the institutional bid that was supposed to push ETH into a new era? If this is the cycle top, then something is broken.\n\n**And where is retail?**\n\nYes, we know the global economy is weak. The US economy is shaky, inflation is sticky, interest rates are high, the job market is rolling over, and retail investors have been burned too many times. People are tired. They remember Terra, Celsius, FTX, and every other implosion that wiped out savings. They learned their lesson. They are sitting out, holding cash, or chasing AI stocks instead (the new crypto get rich quick scheme).\n\nBut if the \u201csmart money\u201d and the \u201csupply shock\u201d narratives are both real, why is price action this lifeless?  Where is the demand that\u2019s supposed to absorb the drained supply?\n\n**But that\u2019s not the whole story.**\n\nBecause the truth is, money is flowing. Just not here.\n\nThe S&P 500, Nasdaq, and even gold are at or near all-time highs. Liquidity is alive and well. Capital hasn\u2019t disappeared. It\u2019s simply choosing not to touch altcoins. Institutions are back in equities and Bitcoin. Retail is speculating on Nvidia instead of LINK or DOT. The excuse that \u201cthe macro environment is too tough\u201d doesn\u2019t hold when traditional markets are booming and Bitcoin is making new highs. The problem isn\u2019t (only) the economy, it\u2019s demand for alts.\n\n**Old playbook: dead?**\n\nMaybe the uncomfortable reality is that the old playbook no longer works. The traditional rotation pattern of BTC pumping first, ETH following, and alts going parabolic appears to be finished. Capital now stops at Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sometimes it touches Solana and a few new narratives. A big part of liquidity in crypto is also spread thin across thousands of useless projects that still somehow trade daily. That\u2019s it.\n\nIf even Ethereum, with its ETF narrative, deflationary supply, and \u201cinstitutional adoption\u201d story, cannot decisively break its previous highs, what chance do the others have?\n\nIf ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, and ALGO fail to reach their previous peaks in this environment, they will not recover in the next one. The next bear market will bury them for good.\n\nThis may be the first cycle where altcoin believers realize that not every \u201cstrong project\u201d will come back. Bitcoin and a handful of layer-1s will survive. The rest will quietly fade away.\n\nMaybe alt season is not delayed. Maybe it didn\u2019t ever start. Maybe it ended already four years ago?\n\nAnd maybe this cycle is the moment when everyone finally looks around and says, \u201cIs this really it?\u201d\n\nIf ETH and alts don\u2019t pick up by the end of the year, the entire crypto market faces two possible outcomes:\n\n1. **Most Altcoins collapse completely in the next bear market.** Retail won\u2019t come back. Total market liquidity shrinks. The old pattern of alt buyers eventually converting into long-term Bitcoin holders disappears. Even Bitcoin takes a hit, because as much as people like to pretend otherwise, institutions still need retail to dump on.\n2. **Everyone simply buys Bitcoin next time.** Retail and institutions both pile into BTC, ignoring altcoins altogether. One-off alts will still rise, but mostly not. Bitcoin becomes the only real trade left. But this is less likely, since the main appeal of altcoins has always been their higher risk-to-reward upside.\n\nEither way, if nothing changes soon, crypto\u2019s future may be far more narrow than most people think.\n\n**TL;DR** Blue-chip alts like ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, ALGO, and even ETH are still far below their 2021 highs. Retail is gone, institutions are all talk, and the classic \u201cBTC -> ETH -> alts\u201d rotation seems dead. If ETH and alts don\u2019t move by year-end, the next bear could wipe out most of the alt market for good, leaving only Bitcoin and a few survivors.", "created_utc": 1759562912.0, "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "score": 271, "num_comments": 292, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nxnlcb/if_this_is_the_bull_market_then_altcoins_are/"}

But now that I've exhausted that, I do not see any reason to use Swan over Strike for DCA purchases. Swan also added an AUM fee for keeping BTC with them and I don't like to withdraw to wallet too often. This really made me disfavor Swan. Plus, Swan charges a 1% fee for any purchase.\n\nAlternatively, Strike has no fees for recurring purchases after a set amount of times doing it, free withdrawals (if you're willing to wait as much as 24 hours), and no AUM fee. Plus the mobile app UI is better imo. I have since switched to Strike. Is there any reason I should stick with Swan? It seems Strike is the superior option. Does Strike have a larger spread I am not considering or anything?\n\nFor buying dips and random purchases when I have extra funds, I think Kraken+ is the way to go. Only $4.99 a month and no trading fees up to $10,000/month. If these kinds of buys are more than $500/month, Kraken+ seems to offer a good deal. Any thoughts on this? Again, maybe the spread is high on Kraken+ that I should just do these buys on Strike too and eat the trading fee there. I know Strike's fee is 1% or lower based on how much you buy in a month.\n\nI don't buy altcoins and so won't be using Kraken+ for that.

So, people settled for \"staggered timeouts\" as a work around, but this does not fix the problem, network failures or denial of service attacks can still cause an innocent intermediary to end up paying for the full payment.\n\nThe solution is to add the penalty on both phases. This is easily done once you realize that the *other* 2-phase commit, that finishes on timeout, also only has a penalty on one of the phases but it has it on the *opposite* phase. Thus, you can simply **combine** them and add a phase in between that shifts the action of the timeout, thus you get a 3-phase commit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/acpqejl9r3tf1.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4714eaa27a4ad245d2ab352a11b3bc69fa9b339\n\nI built Ryan Fugger's base layer already (just 2500 lines of code with zero dependencies) and adding \"collateral\" (\"state proof\" on top of the \"base payment channel\") is very easy. Raiden could be built and finished with minimal work. If anyone is interested. My goal is already achieved with the base layer (as my vision only required it to exits) but I could help out with pointers if anyone wants to get a real Raiden created.\n\nI have more material, video presentation, complete implementation, etc, if anyone is interested. And I can walk anyone through it as well in chat for example here in discussion thread, the 3-phase commit is **very simple** it was just a bit hard to discover as people tend to follow the path already made by others (the cancel-on-timeout 2-phase commit, whereas I approached the other one and naturally noticed both together would *transcend* the limitations of either).\n\nHakuna matata,  \nJohan", "created_utc": 1759587497.0, "subreddit": "ethereum", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nxv7br/3phase_commit_for_true_raiden_network/"}

{"id": "1nxnlcb", "title": "If This Is the Bull Market, Then Altcoins Are Finished", "selftext": "This cycle feels completely off for anyone who isn\u2019t holding Bitcoin.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about meme coins or the latest #1832 CMC gem promoted by a YouTube gambler. I mean the supposed blue chips. The serious, established projects that actually built, shipped, and survived.\n\n**Here\u2019s where things stand (approx. numbers):**\n\n* **ADA** peaked around **$2.90**, now sits near **$0.85**, about 70% down.\n* **LINK** has improved but is still roughly 50\u201360% below its ATH. Market CAP close to ATH (sh\\*t tokenomics?)\n* **DOT** peaked near **$55**, now **$4.29**, over 90% drop.\n* **AAVE** has recovered somewhat but still trades at roughly half its ATH.\n* **ALGO** has been bleeding for two years with no clear bottom in sight.\n\nThese are not vaporware projects. They have real ecosystems, partnerships, and communities. Yet the market refuses to reward them. Even after two years of recovery, they are still deep in red territory.\n\n**Now let's look at Ethereum.**\n\nETH should be leading this cycle. Instead, it is just hovering around its previous ATH. At this stage, ETH should be in clear price discovery, not struggling to hold ground.\n\nEvery other week someone posts about \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cinstitutional demand.\u201d Charts showing exchange reserves collapsing from 16 million to 9 million ETH. Every previous time this happened, a massive rally followed.\n\n**This time, nothing.**\n\nSo where is the rally? Where is the institutional bid that was supposed to push ETH into a new era? If this is the cycle top, then something is broken.\n\n**And where is retail?**\n\nYes, we know the global economy is weak. The US economy is shaky, inflation is sticky, interest rates are high, the job market is rolling over, and retail investors have been burned too many times. People are tired. They remember Terra, Celsius, FTX, and every other implosion that wiped out savings. They learned their lesson. They are sitting out, holding cash, or chasing AI stocks instead (the new crypto get rich quick scheme).\n\nBut if the \u201csmart money\u201d and the \u201csupply shock\u201d narratives are both real, why is price action this lifeless?  Where is the demand that\u2019s supposed to absorb the drained supply?\n\n**But that\u2019s not the whole story.**\n\nBecause the truth is, money is flowing. Just not here.\n\nThe S&P 500, Nasdaq, and even gold are at or near all-time highs. Liquidity is alive and well. Capital hasn\u2019t disappeared. It\u2019s simply choosing not to touch altcoins. Institutions are back in equities and Bitcoin. Retail is speculating on Nvidia instead of LINK or DOT. The excuse that \u201cthe macro environment is too tough\u201d doesn\u2019t hold when traditional markets are booming and Bitcoin is making new highs. The problem isn\u2019t (only) the economy, it\u2019s demand for alts.\n\n**Old playbook: dead?**\n\nMaybe the uncomfortable reality is that the old playbook no longer works. The traditional rotation pattern of BTC pumping first, ETH following, and alts going parabolic appears to be finished. Capital now stops at Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sometimes it touches Solana and a few new narratives. A big part of liquidity in crypto is also spread thin across thousands of useless projects that still somehow trade daily. That\u2019s it.\n\nIf even Ethereum, with its ETF narrative, deflationary supply, and \u201cinstitutional adoption\u201d story, cannot decisively break its previous highs, what chance do the others have?\n\nIf ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, and ALGO fail to reach their previous peaks in this environment, they will not recover in the next one. The next bear market will bury them for good.\n\nThis may be the first cycle where altcoin believers realize that not every \u201cstrong project\u201d will come back. Bitcoin and a handful of layer-1s will survive. The rest will quietly fade away.\n\nMaybe alt season is not delayed. Maybe it didn\u2019t ever start. Maybe it ended already four years ago?\n\nAnd maybe this cycle is the moment when everyone finally looks around and says, \u201cIs this really it?\u201d\n\nIf ETH and alts don\u2019t pick up by the end of the year, the entire crypto market faces two possible outcomes:\n\n1. **Most Altcoins collapse completely in the next bear market.** Retail won\u2019t come back. Total market liquidity shrinks. The old pattern of alt buyers eventually converting into long-term Bitcoin holders disappears. Even Bitcoin takes a hit, because as much as people like to pretend otherwise, institutions still need retail to dump on.\n2. **Everyone simply buys Bitcoin next time.** Retail and institutions both pile into BTC, ignoring altcoins altogether. One-off alts will still rise, but mostly not. Bitcoin becomes the only real trade left. But this is less likely, since the main appeal of altcoins has always been their higher risk-to-reward upside.\n\nEither way, if nothing changes soon, crypto\u2019s future may be far more narrow than most people think.\n\n**TL;DR** Blue-chip alts like ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, ALGO, and even ETH are still far below their 2021 highs. Retail is gone, institutions are all talk, and the classic \u201cBTC -> ETH -> alts\u201d rotation seems dead. If ETH and alts don\u2019t move by year-end, the next bear could wipe out most of the alt market for good, leaving only Bitcoin and a few survivors.", "created_utc": 1759562912.0, "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "score": 269, "num_comments": 292, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nxnlcb/if_this_is_the_bull_market_then_altcoins_are/"}

The biggest chunk of that is Ethereum, sitting at about $830. My average buy-in was around $4,300, which obviously isn\u2019t great. I basically bought near the top without much strategy. That being said, I\u2019m trying to learn and figure out a better plan for the future.\n\nRight now I also hold some Solana and XRP as my other two main positions. Nothing crazy, but they\u2019re the coins I felt somewhat comfortable with at this stage. I also have a tiny meme bag just for fun, but ETH is by far the largest part of my portfolio.\n\nHere\u2019s my actual question: does it make sense to sell my ETH position towards the end of this year, November or December, and then try to buy back in during a potential correction or dip next year? Or is that just trying to time the market, which everyone says is a bad idea, and I should just hold what I\u2019ve got?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my plan for 2026 is to invest much more seriously into both BTC and ETH. This current portfolio is really just a starting point. I don\u2019t mind holding for years, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to reposition better if there\u2019s a dip coming.\n\nWould love to hear what more experienced traders and investors here would do in my situation. Thanks a lot in advance for your perspectives, I really appreciate the input.\n\nTL;DR: New to crypto, small $1.8k portfolio, most in ETH bought at $4.3k avg.

Merkle Tree vs. Consensus\u2014I need a deep technical breakdown.\n> \nBody Text (Expanded for length and depth):\n> I'm an Associate Degree Computer Science student, and I've been wrestling with the concept of \"trustless systems\" as I move from traditional, centralized architectures to decentralized ones like blockchain. In my classes, databases (SQL, etc.) are all about access control, permissions, and relying on a single authority (the admin) to maintain data integrity.\n> When I look at a blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum, I see two distinct technical layers that seem to fight against tampering, and I'm trying to determine which one is truly the foundation of security.\n> 1. Data Integrity (The Merkle Tree / Cryptographic Hashing):\n> The Merkle Tree ensures that the data within a single block hasn't been tampered with. It's a fantastic application of cryptographic hashing, giving us a single root hash to verify all transactions efficiently. This is pure cryptography and data structure genius. If someone changes a transaction, the Merkle Root changes, and the chain linkage is broken.\n> 2. Network Integrity (The Consensus Mechanism\u2014PoW/PoS):\n> The consensus mechanism (whether it's Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake) doesn't seem to deal with the data structure itself, but rather with who gets to write the next block to the chain and, crucially, making sure the entire decentralized network agrees on the correct state and the correct chain history.\n> My core question for the developers and engineers here is this:\n> If a rogue actor were somehow able to forge a Merkle Tree, the next honest miner/validator would immediately reject that block because the hash wouldn't link correctly, essentially making the attack pointless. Doesn't this mean the ultimate source of trust isn't the data structure itself, but the consensus mechanism's economic or computational deterrent that ensures enough honest nodes exist and agree?\n> Where does the technical redundancy lie? Is it fair to say Merkle Trees provide integrity, but the Consensus provides immutability? Any deep technical insights on the relationship between these two components, especially for someone coming from a background focused on centralized system design, would be incredibly helpful.

Daily and weekly golden crosses are in, MACD is flashing bullish, and sentiment is turning from cautious to full-on bullish. $6.9k by year-end looks like the next checkpoint and beyond that $10k+ feels not just possible, but inevitable once Fusaka hype kicks in.\n\nEven TradFi is catching on - VanEck and Standard Chartered are throwing out 5-figure ETH targets, sentiment is buzzing like it\u2019s the start of another mania phase.

But as materkel.eth explained it on Twitter, that myth needs to die. What is true in 2025 is clear: it is faster, cheaper and smarter to deploy a Layer 2 on Ethereum than to create a brand-new L1.\n\nThe math should be self-explanatory, data across the Ethereum network shows L2 transactions costing between $0.01 and $0.10 while L1 fees stay higher. Besides that maintaining an independent L1 means constant work on validators, security and upgrades. L2 teams escape most of that and only work on their product and incentives, the things that are actually bringing in users. Community sentiment evolved too, instead of rival chains discussion now centers on Ethereum's 'superchain' model, where different interconnected L2's reinforce one another while still benefiting from the security of Ethereum. That shared trust layer keeps the whole network stronger, not weaker.\n\nGoing back to the tweet posted by materkel, his view is that any sane CTO will launch an L2. With speed, cost and product attention being the highest values in this world, building yet another L1 is not innovation.. it is distraction.\n\nSource: https://x.com/materkel/status/1973710778092970096", "created_utc": 1759494807.0, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "score": 16, "num_comments": 27, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwxv7p/launching_a_new_l1_today_is_like_starting_a_new/"}

Without accurate attribution, you are lost in the dark forest.\n\n[Onchain attribution](https://formo.so/blog/web3-attribution-and-analytics-onchain-growth-guide-for-web3-marketing-teams) connects user touchpoints across both Web2 and Web3 touchpoints. It tracks the complete user journey from initial discovery through final onchain conversion, using wallet addresses as persistent identifiers.\n\nWeb3 Attribution helps answer key questions:\n\n* Where did users come from?\n* What meaningful activity did users perform on my app?\n* How well are users monetizing? How much revenue did I make? (ARPU, LTV)\n* How long are users sticking around? (Retention, Churn)\n* Is my ROI for an acquisition channel positive? (LTV > CAC)\n\nHowever, there are many challenges in getting attribution right. Web3 users use multiple wallets on multiple chains. Traditional analytics tools miss critical onchain actions.

The Strategic ETH Reserve (SER) bought 3.9 million ETH in only about 2.5 months, this is a complete removal of that issuance. Ethereum community member Etheraider noted this in a tweet that is making us rethink where demand is genuinely coming from. You see.. this is not retail hype, if you take a look at data from [StrategicETHReserve.xyz](http://StrategicETHReserve.xyz) it shows that public institutions now hold over 5.49 million ETH, or around 4.54% of supply, valued at over $23 billion. Institutions like BitMine are accumulating ETH treasuries in billions, this tells us we are seeing a structural trend. If this continues at this pace it is possible that the price reaches more than $10,000.\n\nThe 'ultrasound money' story, once about deflation and EIP-1559 burns, has changed now. After the 2024 Dencun upgrade ETH's supply inflates at a rate of approximately 0.74% each year. Yet the chain's role as a settlement layer still makes it an attractive reserve asset. Institutions are not betting on meme burns and fake hype, they are betting on Ethereum's neutrality and security. So when 4 years of issuance gets tied up in just 2/3 months, it is not only bullish but also a sign. The biggest players are holding ETH less like a trade and more like a foundation.\n\n*Source:* [*https://x.com/etheraider/status/1972728043904102795*](https://x.com/etheraider/status/1972728043904102795)", "created_utc": 1759320974.0, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "score": 91, "num_comments": 20, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nv6kpm/strategic_eth_reserve_buys_4_years_of_ethereum/"}

In a ranting tweet that created a lot of debate, pcaversaccio said that institutional adoption would be detrimental to Ethereum. The issue is that the more institutions get in the more control they will have over Ethereum's future decisions.

Many people on this subreddit have complained about Ethereum's institutional adoption, arguing for exactly what is written here.\n\nGoing back to the tweet pcaversaccio did not just criticize things, he also showed how to resist. First: involve small stakers and retail ETH holders in governance. Second: make the protocol resist external pressure with tools that preserve privacy, this makes corporate control impossible. And third: reward and incentivize builders and users who keep cypherpunk values.\n\nThis is a contrast to the news around ETF's, government pilots and banks testing Ethereum.

The final Yes that can not be undone.\n\nI see Ethereum as a massive global financial hub like Leon does too.\n\n* The main chain (L1) is like the central bank and court system, it sets the rules and records the most critical operations keeping them safe.\n* Layer 2s are booming cities connected by highways and processing huge amounts of commerce but always reporting back to the center.\n* EVM-compatible chains? They are neighboring nations, independent but still tied together by culture, infrastructure and shared technology.\n\nEven with new competitors rising, most important value still flows through Ethereum ecosystem and it keeps growing.

I mean the supposed blue chips. The serious, established projects that actually built, shipped, and survived.\n\n**Here\u2019s where things stand (approx. numbers):**\n\n* **ADA** peaked around **$2.90**, now sits near **$0.85**, about 70% down.\n* **LINK** has improved but is still roughly 50\u201360% below its ATH. Market CAP close to ATH (sh\\*t tokenomics?)\n* **DOT** peaked near **$55**, now **$4.29**, over 90% drop.\n* **AAVE** has recovered somewhat but still trades at roughly half its ATH.\n* **ALGO** has been bleeding for two years with no clear bottom in sight.\n\nThese are not vaporware projects. They have real ecosystems, partnerships, and communities. Yet the market refuses to reward them. Even after two years of recovery, they are still deep in red territory.\n\n**Now let's look at Ethereum.**\n\nETH should be leading this cycle. Instead, it is just hovering around its previous ATH. At this stage, ETH should be in clear price discovery, not struggling to hold ground.\n\nEvery other week someone posts about \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cinstitutional demand.\u201d Charts showing exchange reserves collapsing from 16 million to 9 million ETH. Every previous time this happened, a massive rally followed.\n\n**This time, nothing.**\n\nSo where is the rally? Where is the institutional bid that was supposed to push ETH into a new era? If this is the cycle top, then something is broken.\n\n**And where is retail?**\n\nYes, we know the global economy is weak. The US economy is shaky, inflation is sticky, interest rates are high, the job market is rolling over, and retail investors have been burned too many times. People are tired. They remember Terra, Celsius, FTX, and every other implosion that wiped out savings. They learned their lesson. They are sitting out, holding cash, or chasing AI stocks instead (the new crypto get rich quick scheme).\n\nBut if the \u201csmart money\u201d and the \u201csupply shock\u201d narratives are both real, why is price action this lifeless?  Where is the demand that\u2019s supposed to absorb the drained supply?\n\n**But that\u2019s not the whole story.**\n\nBecause the truth is, money is flowing. Just not here.\n\nThe S&P 500, Nasdaq, and even gold are at or near all-time highs. Liquidity is alive and well. Capital hasn\u2019t disappeared. It\u2019s simply choosing not to touch altcoins. Institutions are back in equities and Bitcoin. Retail is speculating on Nvidia instead of LINK or DOT. The excuse that \u201cthe macro environment is too tough\u201d doesn\u2019t hold when traditional markets are booming and Bitcoin is making new highs. The problem isn\u2019t (only) the economy, it\u2019s demand for alts.\n\n**Old playbook: dead?**\n\nMaybe the uncomfortable reality is that the old playbook no longer works. The traditional rotation pattern of BTC pumping first, ETH following, and alts going parabolic appears to be finished. Capital now stops at Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sometimes it touches Solana and a few new narratives. A big part of liquidity in crypto is also spread thin across thousands of useless projects that still somehow trade daily. That\u2019s it.\n\nIf even Ethereum, with its ETF narrative, deflationary supply, and \u201cinstitutional adoption\u201d story, cannot decisively break its previous highs, what chance do the others have?\n\nIf ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, and ALGO fail to reach their previous peaks in this environment, they will not recover in the next one. The next bear market will bury them for good.\n\nThis may be the first cycle where altcoin believers realize that not every \u201cstrong project\u201d will come back. Bitcoin and a handful of layer-1s will survive. The rest will quietly fade away.\n\nMaybe alt season is not delayed. Maybe it didn\u2019t ever start. Maybe it ended already four years ago?\n\nAnd maybe this cycle is the moment when everyone finally looks around and says, \u201cIs this really it?\u201d\n\nIf ETH and alts don\u2019t pick up by the end of the year, the entire crypto market faces two possible outcomes:\n\n1. **Most Altcoins collapse completely in the next bear market.** Retail won\u2019t come back. Total market liquidity shrinks. The old pattern of alt buyers eventually converting into long-term Bitcoin holders disappears. Even Bitcoin takes a hit, because as much as people like to pretend otherwise, institutions still need retail to dump on.\n2. **Everyone simply buys Bitcoin next time.** Retail and institutions both pile into BTC, ignoring altcoins altogether. One-off alts will still rise, but mostly not. Bitcoin becomes the only real trade left. But this is less likely, since the main appeal of altcoins has always been their higher risk-to-reward upside.\n\nEither way, if nothing changes soon, crypto\u2019s future may be far more narrow than most people think.\n\n**TL;DR** Blue-chip alts like ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, ALGO, and even ETH are still far below their 2021 highs. Retail is gone, institutions are all talk, and the classic \u201cBTC -> ETH -> alts\u201d rotation seems dead. If ETH and alts don\u2019t move by year-end, the next bear could wipe out most of the alt market for good, leaving only Bitcoin and a few survivors.", "created_utc": 1759562912.0, "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "score": 266, "num_comments": 293, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nxnlcb/if_this_is_the_bull_market_then_altcoins_are/"}

Or is that just trying to time the market, which everyone says is a bad idea, and I should just hold what I\u2019ve got?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my plan for 2026 is to invest much more seriously into both BTC and ETH.

But as materkel.eth explained it on Twitter, that myth needs to die. What is true in 2025 is clear: it is faster, cheaper and smarter to deploy a Layer 2 on Ethereum than to create a brand-new L1.\n\nThe math should be self-explanatory, data across the Ethereum network shows L2 transactions costing between $0.01 and $0.10 while L1 fees stay higher. Besides that maintaining an independent L1 means constant work on validators, security and upgrades. L2 teams escape most of that and only work on their product and incentives, the things that are actually bringing in users. Community sentiment evolved too, instead of rival chains discussion now centers on Ethereum's 'superchain' model, where different interconnected L2's reinforce one another while still benefiting from the security of Ethereum. That shared trust layer keeps the whole network stronger, not weaker.\n\nGoing back to the tweet posted by materkel, his view is that any sane CTO will launch an L2. With speed, cost and product attention being the highest values in this world, building yet another L1 is not innovation.. it is distraction.\n\nSource: https://x.com/materkel/status/1973710778092970096", "created_utc": 1759494807.0, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "score": 16, "num_comments": 27, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwxv7p/launching_a_new_l1_today_is_like_starting_a_new/"}

That kind of climb tends to stick better than a straight-line spike. If we start closing days above 4.5k and treating 4.2\u20134.3k as a buyable dip, my base case shifts from \u201crange with wicks\u201d to \u201ctrend with shallow pullbacks.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not leaning on patterns alone. The checklist I care about is spot > futures, funding and basis staying reasonable, and dips getting absorbed without cascading liquidations. If we see that, the path to retesting prior highs isn\u2019t fantasy. If, instead, we get perma-positive funding and a wide futures premium while spot flows fade, that\u2019s a caution flag.\n\nOn chain, I\u2019m watching the boring plumbing: L2 activity and fees trending up but not choking, stablecoin velocity actually used in DeFi vs just sitting, and staking flows remaining steady. None of these are moon signals by themselves, but together they separate healthy momentum from froth.\n\nWhat would invalidate the bull read for me? A weekly close back below 4.0\u20134.1k with rising open interest and heavy long skew would look like trapped chase longs. In that case, it\u2019s back to range until proven otherwise.\n\nMy plan is simple: let price prove it above 4.5k on closes, size positions so a normal pullback doesn\u2019t wreck the thesis, and avoid chasing candles on headline days.

The same people who said Ethereum is overhyped have to deal with the reality that it is quietly becoming the foundation for a new financial layer.

The Strategic ETH Reserve (SER) bought 3.9 million ETH in only about 2.5 months, this is a complete removal of that issuance. Ethereum community member Etheraider noted this in a tweet that is making us rethink where demand is genuinely coming from. You see.. this is not retail hype, if you take a look at data from [StrategicETHReserve.xyz](http://StrategicETHReserve.xyz) it shows that public institutions now hold over 5.49 million ETH, or around 4.54% of supply, valued at over $23 billion. Institutions like BitMine are accumulating ETH treasuries in billions, this tells us we are seeing a structural trend. If this continues at this pace it is possible that the price reaches more than $10,000.\n\nThe 'ultrasound money' story, once about deflation and EIP-1559 burns, has changed now. After the 2024 Dencun upgrade ETH's supply inflates at a rate of approximately 0.74% each year. Yet the chain's role as a settlement layer still makes it an attractive reserve asset. Institutions are not betting on meme burns and fake hype, they are betting on Ethereum's neutrality and security. So when 4 years of issuance gets tied up in just 2/3 months, it is not only bullish but also a sign. The biggest players are holding ETH less like a trade and more like a foundation.\n\n*Source:* [*https://x.com/etheraider/status/1972728043904102795*](https://x.com/etheraider/status/1972728043904102795)", "created_utc": 1759320974.0, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "score": 92, "num_comments": 20, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nv6kpm/strategic_eth_reserve_buys_4_years_of_ethereum/"}

Makes sense: you smooth volatility and remove emotion.\n\nExecution is the interesting part. Most people use Coinbase or Kraken recurring buys...simple, but fees/spreads can add up. I\u2019ve been using Jupiter on Solana for on-chain DCA: set an interval and it routes across DEXs for best price. Way more flexible than most CEX options. Downside: you need to manage SOL for gas and on-chain failures/alerts.\n\nTax reality (US): buying crypto with fiat is not a taxable event. Weekly DCA creates lots of purchases to track for basis, but you don\u2019t have a taxable event until you dispose (sell/trade/spend). On-chain, the gas you pay in SOL is a small taxable disposal of that SOL at its FMV when paid. That\u2019s minor per tx, but real.\n\nBecause DCA multiplies transactions, crypto tax software isn\u2019t optional once volume rises. You\u2019ll want clean lot tracking (Specific ID/HIFO if you can substantiate, otherwise FIFO), fee roll-in to basis, and exports that won\u2019t wreck your 8949 when you eventually sell.\n\nawaken.tax pulls your CEX and wallets, links internal transfers, applies your chosen lot method, and produces clean Form 8949 exports so your DCA doesn\u2019t turn into spreadsheet purgatory at filing time.\n\nMy current setup: weekly BTC/ETH buys, bi-weekly SOL via Jupiter for alts. Took ~30 minutes to configure; then it runs.\n\nAnyone else running DCA? What cadence are you using, and are you staying on CEX for simplicity or going on-chain for flexibility?

The issue is that the more institutions get in the more control they will have over Ethereum's future decisions.

Many people on this subreddit have complained about Ethereum's institutional adoption, arguing for exactly what is written here.\n\nGoing back to the tweet pcaversaccio did not just criticize things, he also showed how to resist. First: involve small stakers and retail ETH holders in governance. Second: make the protocol resist external pressure with tools that preserve privacy, this makes corporate control impossible.

A sustained daily close back above that order block would likely trigger bullish momentum.\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows ETH dropped into the $3,800-$3,900 demand zone and bounced quickly. We're testing $4,200 resistance right now. Above this, $4,300-$4,400 is the next critical resistance level.\n\nIf we fail to reclaim momentum above $4,200, we might consolidate or retest $3,800 support again.

The idea is that no matter your politics, Democrat, Republican, Anarchist or Bureaucrat, Ethereum treats you equally. Your code runs, your property stays safe and above all no one can censor you.\n\nThis matters now more than ever. Big institutions are starting to take Ethereum seriously. Just last week ChinaAMC launched an Ethereum-based product showing confidence in Ethereum's fairness and with Ethereum playing a role in Hong Kong's e-HKD pilot program, we are seeing governments test its use for real-world payments. The roots of this idea go way back as early as 2014, Vitalik described the need for systems that resist centralized control. Even James Madison's Federalist Papers checks-and-balances system is following the same principle: limit power, avoid dependency on middlemen.

{"id": "1nsnify", "title": "Important update about r/EthTrader Special Memberships", "selftext": "Over a year ago, the r/EthTrader mods (now contributors of the Donut DAO) brought back Special Memberships after Reddit discontinued them.\n\nSince then, memberships have been fully independent, managed directly by us. They're represented by mintable NFTs that come with exclusive perks for subscribers.\n\nUntil now, memberships followed a seasonal model. Each season lasted 2 months and came with a unique, tradable NFT.\n\n---\n\n## The change\n\n**After a discussion between the Donut DAO developers, we decided to sunset the seasonal model. The reason is it was unsustainable because of the ongoing maintenance it requires.**\n\nWhen a developer gets busy IRL, parts of the system (like updating prices or frontend displays) can become temporarily unavailable, creating a negative user experience.\n\n**To solve this, we're moving back to the traditional monthly subscription model, the same type originally offered when memberships were supported by Reddit.**\n\nWe deployed a perpetual contract that automatically updates subscription prices without manual maintenance. This will give everyone a much smoother and more reliable experience.\n\n---\n\n## Important notes\n\n* Each membership now lasts 30 days.\n* The price is now $5 in DONUT.\n* Subscriptions do not stack. If you buy 2 memberships, that's 30 days each, not 60.\n* Memberships are only available on Arbitrum One.\n* The price, in DONUT, changes with market activity. Example: if it costs 1,000 DONUT to mint a new card, a trade might increase the price to 1,150 right after. Be sure your wallet allowance covers these small changes.\n* Subscribers will have the same exclusive subreddit privileges as before.\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**What are r/EthTrader Special Memberships?**\n\nSpecial Memberships are monthly subscriptions represented by tradable NFT \"cards\" that offer different perks to subscribers within the r/EthTrader subreddit. Each subscription lasts for 1 month and has its own card (NFT).\n\n**How do I purchase a Special Membership?**\n\nYou can purchase a Special Membership by minting the NFT on the Donut Dashboard.\n\n**How much does a subscription cost?**\n\nThe cost is $5 worth of DONUT.\n\n**What perks do subscribers receive?**\n\nSubscribers have access to several perks, including customizable user flairs and the ability to post GIFs. Additionally, a golden donut will appear in your user flair.\n\n**How do subscriptions work?**\n\nSubscriptions last for 1 month and have an expiration date, which depends on when you minted the NFT.\n\n**Can I stack my subscriptions?**\n\nNo, subscriptions do not stack. If you buy multiple memberships, the duration will remain the same (30 days).\n\n**What happens when the subscription ends?**\n\nWhen your subscription ends, the NFT will expire. As such, you will need to mint a new NFT to maintain your membership perks.\n\n**How do I unlock the subreddit perks?**\n\nThe entire process is automated. Once you mint the NFT, your perks will unlock within a few minutes. To customize your user flair, you can use the `!flair` command, followed by your desired flair description. Example: `!flair my customized flair`\n\n**What happens if I transfer my membership card?**\n\nIf you sell or transfer your NFT, the associated perks will automatically end.\n\n**Can I gift memberships?**\n\nYes, subscriptions can be gifted to other users.\n\n**Can I still keep my old membership card?**\n\nYes, previously minted membership cards (NFTs) are yours to keep, even after they expire. They are a collectible record of your participation in the ecosystem.\n\n**Does the wallet used to hold the membership NFT need to be the same as the one registered in the subreddit?**\n\nYes, the wallet used to hold the membership card must be the same wallet registered in the subreddit, to ensure you have access to all the associated perks.\n\n---\n\n## [Subscribe here](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/membership) (frontend update coming soon!)", "created_utc": 1759063744.0, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "score": 8, "num_comments": 21, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nsnify/important_update_about_rethtrader_special/"}

I mean the supposed blue chips. The serious, established projects that actually built, shipped, and survived.\n\n**Here\u2019s where things stand (approx. numbers):**\n\n* **ADA** peaked around **$2.90**, now sits near **$0.85**, about 70% down.\n* **LINK** has improved but is still roughly 50\u201360% below its ATH. Market CAP close to ATH (sh\\*t tokenomics?)\n* **DOT** peaked near **$55**, now **$4.29**, over 90% drop.\n* **AAVE** has recovered somewhat but still trades at roughly half its ATH.\n* **ALGO** has been bleeding for two years with no clear bottom in sight.\n\nThese are not vaporware projects. They have real ecosystems, partnerships, and communities. Yet the market refuses to reward them. Even after two years of recovery, they are still deep in red territory.\n\n**Now let's look at Ethereum.**\n\nETH should be leading this cycle. Instead, it is just hovering around its previous ATH. At this stage, ETH should be in clear price discovery, not struggling to hold ground.\n\nEvery other week someone posts about \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cinstitutional demand.\u201d Charts showing exchange reserves collapsing from 16 million to 9 million ETH. Every previous time this happened, a massive rally followed.\n\n**This time, nothing.**\n\nSo where is the rally? Where is the institutional bid that was supposed to push ETH into a new era? If this is the cycle top, then something is broken.\n\n**And where is retail?**\n\nYes, we know the global economy is weak. The US economy is shaky, inflation is sticky, interest rates are high, the job market is rolling over, and retail investors have been burned too many times. People are tired. They remember Terra, Celsius, FTX, and every other implosion that wiped out savings. They learned their lesson. They are sitting out, holding cash, or chasing AI stocks instead (the new crypto get rich quick scheme).\n\nBut if the \u201csmart money\u201d and the \u201csupply shock\u201d narratives are both real, why is price action this lifeless?  Where is the demand that\u2019s supposed to absorb the drained supply?\n\n**But that\u2019s not the whole story.**\n\nBecause the truth is, money is flowing. Just not here.\n\nThe S&P 500, Nasdaq, and even gold are at or near all-time highs. Liquidity is alive and well. Capital hasn\u2019t disappeared. It\u2019s simply choosing not to touch altcoins. Institutions are back in equities and Bitcoin. Retail is speculating on Nvidia instead of LINK or DOT. The excuse that \u201cthe macro environment is too tough\u201d doesn\u2019t hold when traditional markets are booming and Bitcoin is making new highs. The problem isn\u2019t (only) the economy, it\u2019s demand for alts.\n\n**Old playbook: dead?**\n\nMaybe the uncomfortable reality is that the old playbook no longer works. The traditional rotation pattern of BTC pumping first, ETH following, and alts going parabolic appears to be finished. Capital now stops at Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sometimes it touches Solana and a few new narratives. A big part of liquidity in crypto is also spread thin across thousands of useless projects that still somehow trade daily. That\u2019s it.\n\nIf even Ethereum, with its ETF narrative, deflationary supply, and \u201cinstitutional adoption\u201d story, cannot decisively break its previous highs, what chance do the others have?\n\nIf ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, and ALGO fail to reach their previous peaks in this environment, they will not recover in the next one. The next bear market will bury them for good.\n\nThis may be the first cycle where altcoin believers realize that not every \u201cstrong project\u201d will come back. Bitcoin and a handful of layer-1s will survive. The rest will quietly fade away.\n\nMaybe alt season is not delayed. Maybe it didn\u2019t ever start. Maybe it ended already four years ago?\n\nAnd maybe this cycle is the moment when everyone finally looks around and says, \u201cIs this really it?\u201d\n\nIf ETH and alts don\u2019t pick up by the end of the year, the entire crypto market faces two possible outcomes:\n\n1. **Most Altcoins collapse completely in the next bear market.** Retail won\u2019t come back. Total market liquidity shrinks. The old pattern of alt buyers eventually converting into long-term Bitcoin holders disappears. Even Bitcoin takes a hit, because as much as people like to pretend otherwise, institutions still need retail to dump on.\n2. **Everyone simply buys Bitcoin next time.** Retail and institutions both pile into BTC, ignoring altcoins altogether. One-off alts will still rise, but mostly not. Bitcoin becomes the only real trade left. But this is less likely, since the main appeal of altcoins has always been their higher risk-to-reward upside.\n\nEither way, if nothing changes soon, crypto\u2019s future may be far more narrow than most people think.\n\n**TL;DR** Blue-chip alts like ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, ALGO, and even ETH are still far below their 2021 highs. Retail is gone, institutions are all talk, and the classic \u201cBTC -> ETH -> alts\u201d rotation seems dead. If ETH and alts don\u2019t move by year-end, the next bear could wipe out most of the alt market for good, leaving only Bitcoin and a few survivors.", "created_utc": 1759562912.0, "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nxnlcb/if_this_is_the_bull_market_then_altcoins_are/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.03151581697698202}

{"id": "1nx9wlo", "title": "New to crypto, looking for advice on my small ETH position", "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m still relatively new to the crypto world and currently only holding a small portfolio, around $1,800 in total. The biggest chunk of that is Ethereum, sitting at about $830. My average buy-in was around $4,300, which obviously isn\u2019t great. I basically bought near the top without much strategy. That being said, I\u2019m trying to learn and figure out a better plan for the future.\n\nRight now I also hold some Solana and XRP as my other two main positions. Nothing crazy, but they\u2019re the coins I felt somewhat comfortable with at this stage. I also have a tiny meme bag just for fun, but ETH is by far the largest part of my portfolio.\n\nHere\u2019s my actual question: does it make sense to sell my ETH position towards the end of this year, November or December, and then try to buy back in during a potential correction or dip next year? Or is that just trying to time the market, which everyone says is a bad idea, and I should just hold what I\u2019ve got?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my plan for 2026 is to invest much more seriously into both BTC and ETH. This current portfolio is really just a starting point. I don\u2019t mind holding for years, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to reposition better if there\u2019s a dip coming.\n\nWould love to hear what more experienced traders and investors here would do in my situation. Thanks a lot in advance for your perspectives, I really appreciate the input.\n\nTL;DR: New to crypto, small $1.8k portfolio, most in ETH bought at $4.3k avg.

But as materkel.eth explained it on Twitter, that myth needs to die. What is true in 2025 is clear: it is faster, cheaper and smarter to deploy a Layer 2 on Ethereum than to create a brand-new L1.\n\nThe math should be self-explanatory, data across the Ethereum network shows L2 transactions costing between $0.01 and $0.10 while L1 fees stay higher. Besides that maintaining an independent L1 means constant work on validators, security and upgrades. L2 teams escape most of that and only work on their product and incentives, the things that are actually bringing in users. Community sentiment evolved too, instead of rival chains discussion now centers on Ethereum's 'superchain' model, where different interconnected L2's reinforce one another while still benefiting from the security of Ethereum. That shared trust layer keeps the whole network stronger, not weaker.\n\nGoing back to the tweet posted by materkel, his view is that any sane CTO will launch an L2. With speed, cost and product attention being the highest values in this world, building yet another L1 is not innovation.. it is distraction.\n\nSource: https://x.com/materkel/status/1973710778092970096", "created_utc": 1759494807.0, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwxv7p/launching_a_new_l1_today_is_like_starting_a_new/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14431818181818185}

These reserves are falling again and every time this has happened before its been the calm before a massive rally.\n\nAccording to the Tweet and the chart:\n\n* **2020-2021:** ETH reserves dropped from 16M to 10M while price barely moved. At that time gas fees were sky high , the network was congested and most of the traders were asleep. Then demand suddenly pumped thanks to events like the UNI airdrop and ETH exploded from \\~$400 to nearly $4,800.\n* **2022-2023:** This time another huge outflow happened. This time from 15M to 9M ETH. This happened during the deep in the bear market, FTX was collapsing, banks were failing but supply quietly bled off exchanges. Once macro conditions improved, ETH rocketed from \\~$1,100 to \\~$4,000.\n* **2024-2025 (Now):** We are currently sitting at historic lows (\\~9.2M ETH) while price is around $4000-$4,500. This means ETH is being accumulated and pulled off exchanges, even if price is not exploding yet.\n\nThis is important because supply leaving exchanges is like draining a bathtub while the tap is still running. If buyers keep coming and sellers eventually run dry, the result is explosive and the price surges because there is simply nothing left to sell and buyers still want it.\n\nLower interest rates, expanding liquidity, institutional money flowing back in. history suggests we are on the verge of another violent rally.\n\nIt's time to explore uncharted territory with ETH price.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482)", "created_utc": 1759472879.0, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwrm8k/ethereum_supply_is_drying_up_fast_and_every_time/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.06831349206349209}

That kind of climb tends to stick better than a straight-line spike. If we start closing days above 4.5k and treating 4.2\u20134.3k as a buyable dip, my base case shifts from \u201crange with wicks\u201d to \u201ctrend with shallow pullbacks.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not leaning on patterns alone. The checklist I care about is spot > futures, funding and basis staying reasonable, and dips getting absorbed without cascading liquidations. If we see that, the path to retesting prior highs isn\u2019t fantasy. If, instead, we get perma-positive funding and a wide futures premium while spot flows fade, that\u2019s a caution flag.\n\nOn chain, I\u2019m watching the boring plumbing: L2 activity and fees trending up but not choking, stablecoin velocity actually used in DeFi vs just sitting, and staking flows remaining steady. None of these are moon signals by themselves, but together they separate healthy momentum from froth.\n\nWhat would invalidate the bull read for me? A weekly close back below 4.0\u20134.1k with rising open interest and heavy long skew would look like trapped chase longs. In that case, it\u2019s back to range until proven otherwise.\n\nMy plan is simple: let price prove it above 4.5k on closes, size positions so a normal pullback doesn\u2019t wreck the thesis, and avoid chasing candles on headline days.

Adriano argues that the tide is turning and Ethereum is moving to its 'genius phase.'\n\nThe time is on point because institutions are locking up millions of ETH in reserves, governments are experimenting with Ethereum for settlement systems and developers are still building tools that unlock new things for the chain.

I mean the supposed blue chips. The serious, established projects that actually built, shipped, and survived.\n\n**Here\u2019s where things stand (approx. numbers):**\n\n* **ADA** peaked around **$2.90**, now sits near **$0.85**, about 70% down.\n* **LINK** has improved but is still roughly 50\u201360% below its ATH. Market CAP close to ATH (sh\\*t tokenomics?)\n* **DOT** peaked near **$55**, now **$4.29**, over 90% drop.\n* **AAVE** has recovered somewhat but still trades at roughly half its ATH.\n* **ALGO** has been bleeding for two years with no clear bottom in sight.\n\nThese are not vaporware projects. They have real ecosystems, partnerships, and communities. Yet the market refuses to reward them. Even after two years of recovery, they are still deep in red territory.\n\n**Now let's look at Ethereum.**\n\nETH should be leading this cycle. Instead, it is just hovering around its previous ATH. At this stage, ETH should be in clear price discovery, not struggling to hold ground.\n\nEvery other week someone posts about \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cinstitutional demand.\u201d Charts showing exchange reserves collapsing from 16 million to 9 million ETH. Every previous time this happened, a massive rally followed.\n\n**This time, nothing.**\n\nSo where is the rally? Where is the institutional bid that was supposed to push ETH into a new era? If this is the cycle top, then something is broken.\n\n**And where is retail?**\n\nYes, we know the global economy is weak. The US economy is shaky, inflation is sticky, interest rates are high, the job market is rolling over, and retail investors have been burned too many times. People are tired. They remember Terra, Celsius, FTX, and every other implosion that wiped out savings. They learned their lesson. They are sitting out, holding cash, or chasing AI stocks instead (the new crypto get rich quick scheme).\n\nBut if the \u201csmart money\u201d and the \u201csupply shock\u201d narratives are both real, why is price action this lifeless?  Where is the demand that\u2019s supposed to absorb the drained supply?\n\n**But that\u2019s not the whole story.**\n\nBecause the truth is, money is flowing. Just not here.\n\nThe S&P 500, Nasdaq, and even gold are at or near all-time highs. Liquidity is alive and well. Capital hasn\u2019t disappeared. It\u2019s simply choosing not to touch altcoins. Institutions are back in equities and Bitcoin. Retail is speculating on Nvidia instead of LINK or DOT. The excuse that \u201cthe macro environment is too tough\u201d doesn\u2019t hold when traditional markets are booming and Bitcoin is making new highs. The problem isn\u2019t (only) the economy, it\u2019s demand for alts.\n\n**Old playbook: dead?**\n\nMaybe the uncomfortable reality is that the old playbook no longer works. The traditional rotation pattern of BTC pumping first, ETH following, and alts going parabolic appears to be finished. Capital now stops at Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sometimes it touches Solana and a few new narratives. A big part of liquidity in crypto is also spread thin across thousands of useless projects that still somehow trade daily. That\u2019s it.\n\nIf even Ethereum, with its ETF narrative, deflationary supply, and \u201cinstitutional adoption\u201d story, cannot decisively break its previous highs, what chance do the others have?\n\nIf ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, and ALGO fail to reach their previous peaks in this environment, they will not recover in the next one. The next bear market will bury them for good.\n\nThis may be the first cycle where altcoin believers realize that not every \u201cstrong project\u201d will come back. Bitcoin and a handful of layer-1s will survive. The rest will quietly fade away.\n\nMaybe alt season is not delayed. Maybe it didn\u2019t ever start. Maybe it ended already four years ago?\n\nAnd maybe this cycle is the moment when everyone finally looks around and says, \u201cIs this really it?\u201d\n\nIf ETH and alts don\u2019t pick up by the end of the year, the entire crypto market faces two possible outcomes:\n\n1. **Most Altcoins collapse completely in the next bear market.** Retail won\u2019t come back. Total market liquidity shrinks. The old pattern of alt buyers eventually converting into long-term Bitcoin holders disappears. Even Bitcoin takes a hit, because as much as people like to pretend otherwise, institutions still need retail to dump on.\n2. **Everyone simply buys Bitcoin next time.** Retail and institutions both pile into BTC, ignoring altcoins altogether. One-off alts will still rise, but mostly not. Bitcoin becomes the only real trade left. But this is less likely, since the main appeal of altcoins has always been their higher risk-to-reward upside.\n\nEither way, if nothing changes soon, crypto\u2019s future may be far more narrow than most people think.\n\n**TL;DR** Blue-chip alts like ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, ALGO, and even ETH are still far below their 2021 highs. Retail is gone, institutions are all talk, and the classic \u201cBTC -> ETH -> alts\u201d rotation seems dead. If ETH and alts don\u2019t move by year-end, the next bear could wipe out most of the alt market for good, leaving only Bitcoin and a few survivors.", "created_utc": 1759562912.0, "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nxnlcb/if_this_is_the_bull_market_then_altcoins_are/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.03151581697698202}

{"id": "1nx9wlo", "title": "New to crypto, looking for advice on my small ETH position", "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m still relatively new to the crypto world and currently only holding a small portfolio, around $1,800 in total. The biggest chunk of that is Ethereum, sitting at about $830. My average buy-in was around $4,300, which obviously isn\u2019t great. I basically bought near the top without much strategy. That being said, I\u2019m trying to learn and figure out a better plan for the future.\n\nRight now I also hold some Solana and XRP as my other two main positions. Nothing crazy, but they\u2019re the coins I felt somewhat comfortable with at this stage. I also have a tiny meme bag just for fun, but ETH is by far the largest part of my portfolio.\n\nHere\u2019s my actual question: does it make sense to sell my ETH position towards the end of this year, November or December, and then try to buy back in during a potential correction or dip next year? Or is that just trying to time the market, which everyone says is a bad idea, and I should just hold what I\u2019ve got?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my plan for 2026 is to invest much more seriously into both BTC and ETH. This current portfolio is really just a starting point. I don\u2019t mind holding for years, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to reposition better if there\u2019s a dip coming.\n\nWould love to hear what more experienced traders and investors here would do in my situation. Thanks a lot in advance for your perspectives, I really appreciate the input.\n\nTL;DR: New to crypto, small $1.8k portfolio, most in ETH bought at $4.3k avg.

But as materkel.eth explained it on Twitter, that myth needs to die. What is true in 2025 is clear: it is faster, cheaper and smarter to deploy a Layer 2 on Ethereum than to create a brand-new L1.\n\nThe math should be self-explanatory, data across the Ethereum network shows L2 transactions costing between $0.01 and $0.10 while L1 fees stay higher. Besides that maintaining an independent L1 means constant work on validators, security and upgrades. L2 teams escape most of that and only work on their product and incentives, the things that are actually bringing in users. Community sentiment evolved too, instead of rival chains discussion now centers on Ethereum's 'superchain' model, where different interconnected L2's reinforce one another while still benefiting from the security of Ethereum. That shared trust layer keeps the whole network stronger, not weaker.\n\nGoing back to the tweet posted by materkel, his view is that any sane CTO will launch an L2. With speed, cost and product attention being the highest values in this world, building yet another L1 is not innovation.. it is distraction.\n\nSource: https://x.com/materkel/status/1973710778092970096", "created_utc": 1759494807.0, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwxv7p/launching_a_new_l1_today_is_like_starting_a_new/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14431818181818185}

These reserves are falling again and every time this has happened before its been the calm before a massive rally.\n\nAccording to the Tweet and the chart:\n\n* **2020-2021:** ETH reserves dropped from 16M to 10M while price barely moved. At that time gas fees were sky high , the network was congested and most of the traders were asleep. Then demand suddenly pumped thanks to events like the UNI airdrop and ETH exploded from \\~$400 to nearly $4,800.\n* **2022-2023:** This time another huge outflow happened. This time from 15M to 9M ETH. This happened during the deep in the bear market, FTX was collapsing, banks were failing but supply quietly bled off exchanges. Once macro conditions improved, ETH rocketed from \\~$1,100 to \\~$4,000.\n* **2024-2025 (Now):** We are currently sitting at historic lows (\\~9.2M ETH) while price is around $4000-$4,500. This means ETH is being accumulated and pulled off exchanges, even if price is not exploding yet.\n\nThis is important because supply leaving exchanges is like draining a bathtub while the tap is still running. If buyers keep coming and sellers eventually run dry, the result is explosive and the price surges because there is simply nothing left to sell and buyers still want it.\n\nLower interest rates, expanding liquidity, institutional money flowing back in. history suggests we are on the verge of another violent rally.\n\nIt's time to explore uncharted territory with ETH price.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482)", "created_utc": 1759472879.0, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwrm8k/ethereum_supply_is_drying_up_fast_and_every_time/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.06831349206349209}

That kind of climb tends to stick better than a straight-line spike. If we start closing days above 4.5k and treating 4.2\u20134.3k as a buyable dip, my base case shifts from \u201crange with wicks\u201d to \u201ctrend with shallow pullbacks.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not leaning on patterns alone. The checklist I care about is spot > futures, funding and basis staying reasonable, and dips getting absorbed without cascading liquidations. If we see that, the path to retesting prior highs isn\u2019t fantasy. If, instead, we get perma-positive funding and a wide futures premium while spot flows fade, that\u2019s a caution flag.\n\nOn chain, I\u2019m watching the boring plumbing: L2 activity and fees trending up but not choking, stablecoin velocity actually used in DeFi vs just sitting, and staking flows remaining steady. None of these are moon signals by themselves, but together they separate healthy momentum from froth.\n\nWhat would invalidate the bull read for me? A weekly close back below 4.0\u20134.1k with rising open interest and heavy long skew would look like trapped chase longs. In that case, it\u2019s back to range until proven otherwise.\n\nMy plan is simple: let price prove it above 4.5k on closes, size positions so a normal pullback doesn\u2019t wreck the thesis, and avoid chasing candles on headline days.

Adriano argues that the tide is turning and Ethereum is moving to its 'genius phase.'\n\nThe time is on point because institutions are locking up millions of ETH in reserves, governments are experimenting with Ethereum for settlement systems and developers are still building tools that unlock new things for the chain. The same people who said Ethereum is overhyped have to deal with the reality that it is quietly becoming the foundation for a new financial layer. Adriano formulates it in terms of more than price action, he calls this the emergence of the 'internet of finance,' a system where value moves as freely as information moved on the early internet.

{"id": "1nxnlcb", "title": "If This Is the Bull Market, Then Altcoins Are Finished", "selftext": "This cycle feels completely off for anyone who isn\u2019t holding Bitcoin.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about meme coins or the latest #1832 CMC gem promoted by a YouTube gambler. I mean the supposed blue chips. The serious, established projects that actually built, shipped, and survived.\n\n**Here\u2019s where things stand (approx. numbers):**\n\n* **ADA** peaked around **$2.90**, now sits near **$0.85**, about 70% down.\n* **LINK** has improved but is still roughly 50\u201360% below its ATH. Market CAP close to ATH (sh\\*t tokenomics?)\n* **DOT** peaked near **$55**, now **$4.29**, over 90% drop.\n* **AAVE** has recovered somewhat but still trades at roughly half its ATH.\n* **ALGO** has been bleeding for two years with no clear bottom in sight.\n\nThese are not vaporware projects. They have real ecosystems, partnerships, and communities. Yet the market refuses to reward them. Even after two years of recovery, they are still deep in red territory.\n\n**Now let's look at Ethereum.**\n\nETH should be leading this cycle. Instead, it is just hovering around its previous ATH. At this stage, ETH should be in clear price discovery, not struggling to hold ground.\n\nEvery other week someone posts about \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cinstitutional demand.\u201d Charts showing exchange reserves collapsing from 16 million to 9 million ETH. Every previous time this happened, a massive rally followed.\n\n**This time, nothing.**\n\nSo where is the rally? Where is the institutional bid that was supposed to push ETH into a new era? If this is the cycle top, then something is broken.\n\n**And where is retail?**\n\nYes, we know the global economy is weak. The US economy is shaky, inflation is sticky, interest rates are high, the job market is rolling over, and retail investors have been burned too many times. People are tired. They remember Terra, Celsius, FTX, and every other implosion that wiped out savings. They learned their lesson. They are sitting out, holding cash, or chasing AI stocks instead (the new crypto get rich quick scheme).\n\nBut if the \u201csmart money\u201d and the \u201csupply shock\u201d narratives are both real, why is price action this lifeless?  Where is the demand that\u2019s supposed to absorb the drained supply?\n\n**But that\u2019s not the whole story.**\n\nBecause the truth is, money is flowing. Just not here.\n\nThe S&P 500, Nasdaq, and even gold are at or near all-time highs. Liquidity is alive and well. Capital hasn\u2019t disappeared. It\u2019s simply choosing not to touch altcoins. Institutions are back in equities and Bitcoin. Retail is speculating on Nvidia instead of LINK or DOT. The excuse that \u201cthe macro environment is too tough\u201d doesn\u2019t hold when traditional markets are booming and Bitcoin is making new highs. The problem isn\u2019t (only) the economy, it\u2019s demand for alts.\n\n**Old playbook: dead?**\n\nMaybe the uncomfortable reality is that the old playbook no longer works. The traditional rotation pattern of BTC pumping first, ETH following, and alts going parabolic appears to be finished. Capital now stops at Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sometimes it touches Solana and a few new narratives. A big part of liquidity in crypto is also spread thin across thousands of useless projects that still somehow trade daily. That\u2019s it.\n\nIf even Ethereum, with its ETF narrative, deflationary supply, and \u201cinstitutional adoption\u201d story, cannot decisively break its previous highs, what chance do the others have?\n\nIf ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, and ALGO fail to reach their previous peaks in this environment, they will not recover in the next one. The next bear market will bury them for good.\n\nThis may be the first cycle where altcoin believers realize that not every \u201cstrong project\u201d will come back. Bitcoin and a handful of layer-1s will survive. The rest will quietly fade away.\n\nMaybe alt season is not delayed. Maybe it didn\u2019t ever start. Maybe it ended already four years ago?\n\nAnd maybe this cycle is the moment when everyone finally looks around and says, \u201cIs this really it?\u201d\n\nIf ETH and alts don\u2019t pick up by the end of the year, the entire crypto market faces two possible outcomes:\n\n1. **Most Altcoins collapse completely in the next bear market.** Retail won\u2019t come back. Total market liquidity shrinks. The old pattern of alt buyers eventually converting into long-term Bitcoin holders disappears. Even Bitcoin takes a hit, because as much as people like to pretend otherwise, institutions still need retail to dump on.\n2. **Everyone simply buys Bitcoin next time.** Retail and institutions both pile into BTC, ignoring altcoins altogether. One-off alts will still rise, but mostly not. Bitcoin becomes the only real trade left. But this is less likely, since the main appeal of altcoins has always been their higher risk-to-reward upside.\n\nEither way, if nothing changes soon, crypto\u2019s future may be far more narrow than most people think.\n\n**TL;DR** Blue-chip alts like ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, ALGO, and even ETH are still far below their 2021 highs. Retail is gone, institutions are all talk, and the classic \u201cBTC -> ETH -> alts\u201d rotation seems dead. If ETH and alts don\u2019t move by year-end, the next bear could wipe out most of the alt market for good, leaving only Bitcoin and a few survivors.", "created_utc": "2025-10-04 07:28:32", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nxnlcb/if_this_is_the_bull_market_then_altcoins_are/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.03151581697698202}

The biggest chunk of that is Ethereum, sitting at about $830. My average buy-in was around $4,300, which obviously isn\u2019t great. I basically bought near the top without much strategy. That being said, I\u2019m trying to learn and figure out a better plan for the future.\n\nRight now I also hold some Solana and XRP as my other two main positions. Nothing crazy, but they\u2019re the coins I felt somewhat comfortable with at this stage. I also have a tiny meme bag just for fun, but ETH is by far the largest part of my portfolio.\n\nHere\u2019s my actual question: does it make sense to sell my ETH position towards the end of this year, November or December, and then try to buy back in during a potential correction or dip next year? Or is that just trying to time the market, which everyone says is a bad idea, and I should just hold what I\u2019ve got?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my plan for 2026 is to invest much more seriously into both BTC and ETH. This current portfolio is really just a starting point. I don\u2019t mind holding for years, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to reposition better if there\u2019s a dip coming.\n\nWould love to hear what more experienced traders and investors here would do in my situation. Thanks a lot in advance for your perspectives, I really appreciate the input.\n\nTL;DR: New to crypto, small $1.8k portfolio, most in ETH bought at $4.3k avg.

{"id": "1nwxv7p", "title": "Launching a new L1 today is like starting a new MySpace.", "selftext": "For years blockchain projects chased the idea of the 'L1 premium,' that it would get you more credibility and value in the long-term if you introduced a new Layer 1 chain. But as materkel.eth explained it on Twitter, that myth needs to die. What is true in 2025 is clear: it is faster, cheaper and smarter to deploy a Layer 2 on Ethereum than to create a brand-new L1.\n\nThe math should be self-explanatory, data across the Ethereum network shows L2 transactions costing between $0.01 and $0.10 while L1 fees stay higher. Besides that maintaining an independent L1 means constant work on validators, security and upgrades. L2 teams escape most of that and only work on their product and incentives, the things that are actually bringing in users. Community sentiment evolved too, instead of rival chains discussion now centers on Ethereum's 'superchain' model, where different interconnected L2's reinforce one another while still benefiting from the security of Ethereum. That shared trust layer keeps the whole network stronger, not weaker.\n\nGoing back to the tweet posted by materkel, his view is that any sane CTO will launch an L2. With speed, cost and product attention being the highest values in this world, building yet another L1 is not innovation.. it is distraction.\n\nSource: https://x.com/materkel/status/1973710778092970096", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 12:33:27", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwxv7p/launching_a_new_l1_today_is_like_starting_a_new/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14431818181818185}

These reserves are falling again and every time this has happened before its been the calm before a massive rally.\n\nAccording to the Tweet and the chart:\n\n* **2020-2021:** ETH reserves dropped from 16M to 10M while price barely moved. At that time gas fees were sky high , the network was congested and most of the traders were asleep. Then demand suddenly pumped thanks to events like the UNI airdrop and ETH exploded from \\~$400 to nearly $4,800.\n* **2022-2023:** This time another huge outflow happened. This time from 15M to 9M ETH. This happened during the deep in the bear market, FTX was collapsing, banks were failing but supply quietly bled off exchanges. Once macro conditions improved, ETH rocketed from \\~$1,100 to \\~$4,000.\n* **2024-2025 (Now):** We are currently sitting at historic lows (\\~9.2M ETH) while price is around $4000-$4,500. This means ETH is being accumulated and pulled off exchanges, even if price is not exploding yet.\n\nThis is important because supply leaving exchanges is like draining a bathtub while the tap is still running. If buyers keep coming and sellers eventually run dry, the result is explosive and the price surges because there is simply nothing left to sell and buyers still want it.\n\nLower interest rates, expanding liquidity, institutional money flowing back in. history suggests we are on the verge of another violent rally.\n\nIt's time to explore uncharted territory with ETH price.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482)", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 06:27:59", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwrm8k/ethereum_supply_is_drying_up_fast_and_every_time/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.06831349206349209}

That kind of climb tends to stick better than a straight-line spike. If we start closing days above 4.5k and treating 4.2\u20134.3k as a buyable dip, my base case shifts from \u201crange with wicks\u201d to \u201ctrend with shallow pullbacks.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not leaning on patterns alone. The checklist I care about is spot > futures, funding and basis staying reasonable, and dips getting absorbed without cascading liquidations. If we see that, the path to retesting prior highs isn\u2019t fantasy. If, instead, we get perma-positive funding and a wide futures premium while spot flows fade, that\u2019s a caution flag.\n\nOn chain, I\u2019m watching the boring plumbing: L2 activity and fees trending up but not choking, stablecoin velocity actually used in DeFi vs just sitting, and staking flows remaining steady. None of these are moon signals by themselves, but together they separate healthy momentum from froth.\n\nWhat would invalidate the bull read for me? A weekly close back below 4.0\u20134.1k with rising open interest and heavy long skew would look like trapped chase longs. In that case, it\u2019s back to range until proven otherwise.\n\nMy plan is simple: let price prove it above 4.5k on closes, size positions so a normal pullback doesn\u2019t wreck the thesis, and avoid chasing candles on headline days.

That is where Ethereum has been: dismissed, doubted and even mocked. Adriano argues that the tide is turning and Ethereum is moving to its 'genius phase.'\n\nThe time is on point because institutions are locking up millions of ETH in reserves, governments are experimenting with Ethereum for settlement systems and developers are still building tools that unlock new things for the chain. The same people who said Ethereum is overhyped have to deal with the reality that it is quietly becoming the foundation for a new financial layer. Adriano formulates it in terms of more than price action, he calls this the emergence of the 'internet of finance,' a system where value moves as freely as information moved on the early internet.

{"id": "1o06rpc", "title": "What will Privacy in Crypto look like in 10 years?", "selftext": "With crypto, having an open ledger is both its greatest strength and its biggest flaw. The transparency that allows anyone to verify transactions and trust the blockchain without intermediaries also means that every payment, trade, or wallet movement is visible to the world for all time. While this openness builds security and accountability, it strips away a fundamental layer of personal privacy that traditional finance still protects. As crypto adoption grows, we have seen several options evolve for privacy. In the last 7 days, privacy crypto has boomed considerably. What are the main players and options out there?\n\n1. Privacy First Native Blockchain - The most well known here is Monero (XMR). This method achieves privacy by default using cryptographic primitives like ring signatures to obscure sender among a set, stealth addresses so recipients\u2019 addresses are not publicly visible, and Ring Confidential Transactions hide amounts. The real advantage here is privacy is inherent. However, because Monero is strongly private, it tends to attract suspicion from regulators as being a tool for illicit activity. There are also limitations around DeFi smart contract capabilities.\n2. Decentralised Mixers - The biggest here is Tornado Cash (TORN). This works by users deposit ing ETH or ERC-20 tokens into a pool, wait a while, and then withdraw to a different address. The zero knowledge proof shows a depositor has the right to withdraw without revealing which deposit is theirs. The benefit here is in the simplicity however, again, sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 but then lifted in March 2025 as deemed unenforcable. Also you can see pool visibility so regulators can blacklist addresses that interact with it.\n3. On-chain privacy tooling - Railgun (RAIL) is the most notable, being used and backed by Vitalik Buterin. This process again works though utilisation of zero knowledge proofs across all EVM chains (Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.) and because of this it sits on-chain and works with existing EVM networks, users don\u2019t need to move assets off chain or into side networks. Technology wise, this is the most advanced. The down side is potential regulatory changes and in terms of when funds enter or exit the shielded pool, there may still be traces or timing heuristics.\n\nI personally think there is a future for all three. However, I think Monero has largely reached its potential. Based on market cap, I see the biggest growth in Railgun and Tornado Cash.\n\nWhat do you think privacy in crypto will look like in the next 5-10 years?\n\n\\*Edit: Updated to include lift of sanctions", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 06:00:36", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o06rpc/what_will_privacy_in_crypto_look_like_in_10_years/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.19197845804988664}

From my understand Hype was taking A TON of perp volume from Binance resulting in Binance arguably not being happy.\n\nThis lead to Binance Labs and CZ backing a perp DEX called Aster\n\n[https:\\/\\/x.com\\/cz\\_binance\\/status\\/1912414352969212139](https://preview.redd.it/tzaa6qi08mtf1.png?width=405&format=png&auto=webp&s=97fc6810b8a0a8233ed7bda3c31a37bbb46a2386)\n\nThis platform launched a token a few weeks ago and since they did CZ has been non stop pumping Aster. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sg0zt8ef8mtf1.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=244b6ee1d2a54d2b423e177822f72949778bb22c\n\nIn fact you might have heard of a post yesterday from defi lama that accused BNB of working with Aster to wash trade for volume. [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nz2b34/defillama_delists_aster_from_website_after/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t03ogkcn3mtf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7229dd373db3300e87c1c9907705c819f813a2a1\n\nFrom the available evidence it seems clear **AT THE VERY LEAST** BNB/CZ doesn't like Hype as it take potential revenue and they are working to some extent with a competing leverage DEX to steal marketshare and redirect those traders back into platforms where Binance has a hand in the pot.\n\nBut that's only half the story. The other half is in Hypes price chart. Hype has been unable to hold any recovery gains since this all started while Bitcoin keeps climbing and hitting new ATHs. Hype is currently exactly where it was when Bitcoin was 112k just ten days ago. With any Bitcoin fueled Hype rally just as quickly being sold off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itq0a2xn4mtf1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=1958a78f080183ff1c929a1a6a5b18ef5e8bf161\n\nFrom what I've been thinking someone with enough money could suppress price discovery of Hype while Bitcoin goes for a brand new ATH. Then when Bitcoin 'eventually' naturally retraces Hype along with other alts will likely drop more and they could close short leverage positions in profit. It's not a sure thing but it seems like a strategic bet if we assume price and profit has to do with users and fees.\n\nSo my question is, is this movement the result of a local bubble or is it something CZ Binance and CO have something to do with?", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 04:08:06", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o04snj/is_the_hype_token_being_crimed_by_cz_binance_or/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.04759740259740259}

This is something that has not been seen in 30 years. Also on top of this the labor market outlook is getting weaker, deficit spending is well over $2 trillion annually and even jobs reports are on hold because of the government shutdown. And.. the Fed is not finished yet. Two more cuts are expected this year even as the U.S. is fighting against stagflation, slow growth mixed with high inflation. In the meantime tech giants are pouring over $100 billion every quarter into AI showing just how uneven the economy has become.\n\nWhat does this mean for us regular people?? Well the message is clear: hold assets or get left behind. Cash loses value when inflation stays sticky. Traditional bonds do not keep up when rates fall faster than prices. Assets that have independence from government policy, like ETH, stand out in this environment. As we all know well ETH is no longer just a speculative bet, it is increasingly being used as a reserve and settlement layer by institutions. If stagflation is here as it would seem then the old rule applies again: hard assets are the winner.. and for many more investors ETH is one of them.\n\nSource: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974092991842132271", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 10:39:01", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nzfipg/why_stagflation_and_fed_rate_cuts_point_toward/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.02591666666666667}

{"id": "1o084lx", "title": "CEX way to earn passively, or Ocean Protocol decentralized nodes. What do you choose?", "selftext": "Is anyone else keeping tabs on Ocean Nodes lately? Phase 1 wrapped up this summer and honestly, the numbers were insane \u2014 over 1.7 million nodes deployed across 70+ countries. That\u2019s not small-scale testing anymore, that\u2019s real global reach. The first phase proved that decentralized compute can actually work and scale beyond expectations.\n\nNow, everyone\u2019s waiting on Phase 2, which was expected to kick off around September, but it seems we\u2019re still in the prep and testing stage. The Ocean team is running GPU benchmark jobs to evaluate performance and stability before going fully live. It\u2019s a smart move \u2014 this next step isn\u2019t just about keeping nodes online, it\u2019s about real compute power.\n\nPhase 2 will focus on GPU-based workloads like model training, fine-tuning, and AI tasks that actually use serious resources. Rewards will switch from uptime-based to performance-based, meaning your earnings depend on how much useful compute your node provides. There\u2019ll also be upgraded dashboards, monitoring tools, and more control over your node setup.\n\nI really like where this is going \u2014 it feels like Ocean is evolving from a community experiment into something close to a decentralized AI cloud. Sure, we\u2019re all impatient to see it live, but the direction looks solid.\n\nWhat do you all think? Do you see this model actually competing with centralized compute providers someday? Or is it still too early in the game?", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 07:25:45", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o084lx/cex_way_to_earn_passively_or_ocean_protocol/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.03494259363824583}

The real competitive battle is no longer about which Layer 1 is best, but which L1/L2 combo can handle the massive volume of AI agent micro-transactions.\n\n\n1) The L2 Necessity: The planned proliferation of AI agents equipped with crypto wallets necessitates instant, cost-effective settlement. Since base Layer 1s cannot provide the required throughput, L2s (Stacks, Arbitrum, Optimism) are becoming the indispensable \"AI Payment Rails\".  \n\n2) Solana's Structural Edge: High-speed L1s like Solana are positioned favorably due to superior scalability and low cost. Citigroup's exploration of Solana confirms its technical viability for payments.  \n\n3) Revenue Model Shift: Trading platforms are moving from volatile transaction fees to stable income. Coinbase's profit is driven by subscription and staking revenue, while Robinhood monetizes engagement via prediction markets (2 billion contracts in Q3).  \n\nWill Solana's high-speed L1 architecture dominate the future of RWA/AI utility, or will the L2 ecosystem's fundamental security (built atop BTC/ETH) ultimately become the required institutional rail?", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 06:19:43", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o0734i/solana_vs_l2s_why_the_ai_agent_boom_just_made/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.13035714285714287}

For context, I live in the U.S and only use Coinbase (I do not use Binance) and I primarily use DEXes since I just spot hold mostly memecoins or altcoins.\n\nOne way is to just straight up cash everything into your bank account to U.S dollars via Coinbase. I assume this is what MOST people do. But of course there is going to be a huge tax reduction especially if you cash out from crypto right away and not hold long-term.  But there is the argument that U.S dollar is declining, and that it's inflating, and fiat currency is a bottomless pit....\n\n  \nAnother option I been hearing alot lately is converting it all into stablecoins and just holding all profits in stablecoins. How do you feel about this route? Also, on the side note, which is the best stablecoin? Tether or USDC?\n\n  \nThe last option I can think of is just converting all profits into Bitcoin and just holding Bitcoin.  Not cashing anything to bank. Obviously alot of money will be saved because of tax reasons from this. Maybe one day you can buy a house or groceries with bitcoin lol.

{"id": "1o06rpc", "title": "What will Privacy in Crypto look like in 10 years?", "selftext": "With crypto, having an open ledger is both its greatest strength and its biggest flaw. The transparency that allows anyone to verify transactions and trust the blockchain without intermediaries also means that every payment, trade, or wallet movement is visible to the world for all time. While this openness builds security and accountability, it strips away a fundamental layer of personal privacy that traditional finance still protects. As crypto adoption grows, we have seen several options evolve for privacy. In the last 7 days, privacy crypto has boomed considerably. What are the main players and options out there?\n\n1. Privacy First Native Blockchain - The most well known here is Monero (XMR). This method achieves privacy by default using cryptographic primitives like ring signatures to obscure sender among a set, stealth addresses so recipients\u2019 addresses are not publicly visible, and Ring Confidential Transactions hide amounts. The real advantage here is privacy is inherent. However, because Monero is strongly private, it tends to attract suspicion from regulators as being a tool for illicit activity. There are also limitations around DeFi smart contract capabilities.\n2. Decentralised Mixers - The biggest here is Tornado Cash (TORN). This works by users deposit ing ETH or ERC-20 tokens into a pool, wait a while, and then withdraw to a different address. The zero knowledge proof shows a depositor has the right to withdraw without revealing which deposit is theirs. The benefit here is in the simplicity however, again, sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 but then lifted in March 2025 as deemed unenforcable. Also you can see pool visibility so regulators can blacklist addresses that interact with it.\n3. On-chain privacy tooling - Railgun (RAIL) is the most notable, being used and backed by Vitalik Buterin. This process again works though utilisation of zero knowledge proofs across all EVM chains (Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.) and because of this it sits on-chain and works with existing EVM networks, users don\u2019t need to move assets off chain or into side networks. Technology wise, this is the most advanced. The down side is potential regulatory changes and in terms of when funds enter or exit the shielded pool, there may still be traces or timing heuristics.\n\nI personally think there is a future for all three. However, I think Monero has largely reached its potential. Based on market cap, I see the biggest growth in Railgun and Tornado Cash.\n\nWhat do you think privacy in crypto will look like in the next 5-10 years?\n\n\\*Edit: Updated to include lift of sanctions", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 06:00:36", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o06rpc/what_will_privacy_in_crypto_look_like_in_10_years/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.19197845804988664}

The other half is in Hypes price chart. Hype has been unable to hold any recovery gains since this all started while Bitcoin keeps climbing and hitting new ATHs.

Then when Bitcoin 'eventually' naturally retraces Hype along with other alts will likely drop more and they could close short leverage positions in profit.

{"id": "1nzfipg", "title": "Why stagflation and Fed rate cuts point toward owning assets like Ethereum.", "selftext": "So the U.S. economy is getting into uncharted territory, the Kobeissi Letter summed it up pretty well on Twitter: rate cuts are happening while core inflation is still a little over 2.9%. This is something that has not been seen in 30 years. Also on top of this the labor market outlook is getting weaker, deficit spending is well over $2 trillion annually and even jobs reports are on hold because of the government shutdown. And.. the Fed is not finished yet. Two more cuts are expected this year even as the U.S. is fighting against stagflation, slow growth mixed with high inflation. In the meantime tech giants are pouring over $100 billion every quarter into AI showing just how uneven the economy has become.\n\nWhat does this mean for us regular people?? Well the message is clear: hold assets or get left behind. Cash loses value when inflation stays sticky. Traditional bonds do not keep up when rates fall faster than prices. Assets that have independence from government policy, like ETH, stand out in this environment. As we all know well ETH is no longer just a speculative bet, it is increasingly being used as a reserve and settlement layer by institutions. If stagflation is here as it would seem then the old rule applies again: hard assets are the winner.. and for many more investors ETH is one of them.\n\nSource: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974092991842132271", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 10:39:01", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nzfipg/why_stagflation_and_fed_rate_cuts_point_toward/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.02591666666666667}

That is 330x more than what you will get for commenting in other communities and it will literally takes seconds of effort. But this is not all, if you make a post, you are looking at 836 DONUT minus 250 Pay2Post which is still an insane return.\n\nFurthermore to prevent spam and stress, we added a rule to max the reward to **42500 DONUT** currently around **$169.41** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xroj43bbfgtf1.png?width=1291&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e73150cb631bd86731a98ecf32d37875a754ff0\n\nIn summary, people are out there commenting and posting for Internet Magic Points called karma while losing the chance to do both and also earn DONUT that can be converted to real money.\n\nMy advice is to hold them because selling has a penalization if you sell more than 25% (I think) and because DONUT price right now is really cheap so you can even make more.\n\nSo here is the idea, register a wallet address, start commenting, start posting and watch your DONUT bags grow. **And of course always try to share quality content and don't spam**. Just enjoy the community with one account and I assure you that your future will be better.\n\n# \ud83e\ude99 How to make others earn DONUT\n\nThis one is simple, if you want to reward someone's comment or post because you liked it or feel like it deserves it you just need to write the following command in the comment replacing NUMBER by the amount you want to tip\n\n`!tip NUMBER`\n\nIts important to say that this tips will be deducted from the ones you will earn in the incoming distribution.

Phase 1 wrapped up this summer and honestly, the numbers were insane \u2014 over 1.7 million nodes deployed across 70+ countries. That\u2019s not small-scale testing anymore, that\u2019s real global reach. The first phase proved that decentralized compute can actually work and scale beyond expectations.\n\nNow, everyone\u2019s waiting on Phase 2, which was expected to kick off around September, but it seems we\u2019re still in the prep and testing stage. The Ocean team is running GPU benchmark jobs to evaluate performance and stability before going fully live. It\u2019s a smart move \u2014 this next step isn\u2019t just about keeping nodes online, it\u2019s about real compute power.\n\nPhase 2 will focus on GPU-based workloads like model training, fine-tuning, and AI tasks that actually use serious resources. Rewards will switch from uptime-based to performance-based, meaning your earnings depend on how much useful compute your node provides. There\u2019ll also be upgraded dashboards, monitoring tools, and more control over your node setup.\n\nI really like where this is going \u2014 it feels like Ocean is evolving from a community experiment into something close to a decentralized AI cloud. Sure, we\u2019re all impatient to see it live, but the direction looks solid.\n\nWhat do you all think? Do you see this model actually competing with centralized compute providers someday?

Privacy First Native Blockchain - The most well known here is Monero (XMR). This method achieves privacy by default using cryptographic primitives like ring signatures to obscure sender among a set, stealth addresses so recipients\u2019 addresses are not publicly visible, and Ring Confidential Transactions hide amounts. The real advantage here is privacy is inherent. However, because Monero is strongly private, it tends to attract suspicion from regulators as being a tool for illicit activity. There are also limitations around DeFi smart contract capabilities.\n2. Decentralised Mixers - The biggest here is Tornado Cash (TORN). This works by users deposit ing ETH or ERC-20 tokens into a pool, wait a while, and then withdraw to a different address. The zero knowledge proof shows a depositor has the right to withdraw without revealing which deposit is theirs. The benefit here is in the simplicity however, again, sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 but then lifted in March 2025 as deemed unenforcable. Also you can see pool visibility so regulators can blacklist addresses that interact with it.\n3. On-chain privacy tooling - Railgun (RAIL) is the most notable, being used and backed by Vitalik Buterin. This process again works though utilisation of zero knowledge proofs across all EVM chains (Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.) and because of this it sits on-chain and works with existing EVM networks, users don\u2019t need to move assets off chain or into side networks. Technology wise, this is the most advanced. The down side is potential regulatory changes and in terms of when funds enter or exit the shielded pool, there may still be traces or timing heuristics.\n\nI personally think there is a future for all three. However, I think Monero has largely reached its potential. Based on market cap, I see the biggest growth in Railgun and Tornado Cash.\n\nWhat do you think privacy in crypto will look like in the next 5-10 years?\n\n\\*Edit: Updated to include lift of sanctions", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 06:00:36", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o06rpc/what_will_privacy_in_crypto_look_like_in_10_years/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.19197845804988664}

From my understand Hype was taking A TON of perp volume from Binance resulting in Binance arguably not being happy.\n\nThis lead to Binance Labs and CZ backing a perp DEX called Aster\n\n[https:\\/\\/x.com\\/cz\\_binance\\/status\\/1912414352969212139](https://preview.redd.it/tzaa6qi08mtf1.png?width=405&format=png&auto=webp&s=97fc6810b8a0a8233ed7bda3c31a37bbb46a2386)\n\nThis platform launched a token a few weeks ago and since they did CZ has been non stop pumping Aster. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sg0zt8ef8mtf1.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=244b6ee1d2a54d2b423e177822f72949778bb22c\n\nIn fact you might have heard of a post yesterday from defi lama that accused BNB of working with Aster to wash trade for volume. [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nz2b34/defillama_delists_aster_from_website_after/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t03ogkcn3mtf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7229dd373db3300e87c1c9907705c819f813a2a1\n\nFrom the available evidence it seems clear **AT THE VERY LEAST** BNB/CZ doesn't like Hype as it take potential revenue and they are working to some extent with a competing leverage DEX to steal marketshare and redirect those traders back into platforms where Binance has a hand in the pot.\n\nBut that's only half the story. The other half is in Hypes price chart. Hype has been unable to hold any recovery gains since this all started while Bitcoin keeps climbing and hitting new ATHs. Hype is currently exactly where it was when Bitcoin was 112k just ten days ago. With any Bitcoin fueled Hype rally just as quickly being sold off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itq0a2xn4mtf1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=1958a78f080183ff1c929a1a6a5b18ef5e8bf161\n\nFrom what I've been thinking someone with enough money could suppress price discovery of Hype while Bitcoin goes for a brand new ATH. Then when Bitcoin 'eventually' naturally retraces Hype along with other alts will likely drop more and they could close short leverage positions in profit. It's not a sure thing but it seems like a strategic bet if we assume price and profit has to do with users and fees.\n\nSo my question is, is this movement the result of a local bubble or is it something CZ Binance and CO have something to do with?", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 04:08:06", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o04snj/is_the_hype_token_being_crimed_by_cz_binance_or/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.04759740259740259}

It\u2019s not even about the money, it\u2019s about the feeling that i\u2019m giving up at the worst possible moment. I\u2019ve held some positions through every kind of market condition, from huge runs to brutal crashes, because I believed in what they stood for. They felt real, built on something solid, and that made it hard to let go even when the market clearly didn\u2019t care.  \n  \nStill, it\u2019s hard not to question myself when other trades go wrong. My best trade ever was one I entered on a random hunch and it ended up being the biggest win I\u2019ve ever had. Then came another one that turned into a disaster, just constant bleeding, new lows every week, and no sign of recovery. I told myself I don\u2019t sell cheap, but sometimes holding feels like pretending something still has life when it\u2019s clearly gone.  \n  \nLately I\u2019ve been trying to see selling differently. Maybe it\u2019s not about quitting or being weak, maybe it\u2019s just part of staying sane in a market that never really stops moving. Some trades work out, others don\u2019t, and the real challenge for me is knowing which ones still deserve my patience. I still hate selling cheap, even atm i saw aster trending on cmc i checked on bitget and saw it added to my portfolio.

A similar analysis was done on the S&P 500.  The underlying assumption was, \"what if I suck at investing and only invested at market peaks?\"  The short answer is, 'you still make money'. \n\nI am attempting to replicate this for BTC (this is what happens when I drink).\n\nAssumptions\n\n* Assume you DCA $20 per week.\n* Assume you suck at investing and due to FOMO, you only buy at 'market highs'\n* Assume you suck so much that you purchase at the highest price during that day.\n* All numbers are USD\n\n**Method**: I pulled all data for BTC on a weekly basis.  I buy at the highest price on the given day and only if that is a 'new market high'.  First buy is $20 USD on 1/1/2017.  It takes 7 weeks to hit the next high, so I invest that $140 at the new 'high price'.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cuidsmtsqktf1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=d43054595173065cc302b105cc807bc9bd7036c0\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe table below reflects if you started this $20 DCA strategy in January of each year.  If you started in 2017, your total investment from 2017 through 2025 would be 9,100.  Your BTC would be valued at $80.7K.

{"id": "1nzfipg", "title": "Why stagflation and Fed rate cuts point toward owning assets like Ethereum.", "selftext": "So the U.S. economy is getting into uncharted territory, the Kobeissi Letter summed it up pretty well on Twitter: rate cuts are happening while core inflation is still a little over 2.9%. This is something that has not been seen in 30 years. Also on top of this the labor market outlook is getting weaker, deficit spending is well over $2 trillion annually and even jobs reports are on hold because of the government shutdown. And.. the Fed is not finished yet. Two more cuts are expected this year even as the U.S. is fighting against stagflation, slow growth mixed with high inflation. In the meantime tech giants are pouring over $100 billion every quarter into AI showing just how uneven the economy has become.\n\nWhat does this mean for us regular people?? Well the message is clear: hold assets or get left behind. Cash loses value when inflation stays sticky. Traditional bonds do not keep up when rates fall faster than prices. Assets that have independence from government policy, like ETH, stand out in this environment. As we all know well ETH is no longer just a speculative bet, it is increasingly being used as a reserve and settlement layer by institutions. If stagflation is here as it would seem then the old rule applies again: hard assets are the winner.. and for many more investors ETH is one of them.\n\nSource: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974092991842132271", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 10:39:01", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nzfipg/why_stagflation_and_fed_rate_cuts_point_toward/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.02591666666666667}
{"id": "1nzdxg8", "title": "Stop Sleeping: People Are Missing Out on Easy DONUT Gains", "selftext": "Okay, lets get real for a second guys, people are sleeping on the DONUT game being played here at r/ethtrader and I am just going to show you why.\n\nIf you have been casually commenting or posting in r/ethtrader community, you might not realize that you can earn a good chunk of DONUT without even breaking a sweat.\n\nLet's share some data from [last distribution cycle ](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nql0b2/donut_distribution_data_for_round_154_final_csv/)\n\n* **Max DONUT you can earn:** 42,500\n* **Comment ratio:** 330.22 per tip (from a full weight user - dont worry about this right now)\n* **Post ratio:** 836.64 per post\n* **Pay2post ratio:** 250 DONUT (fee deducted from your final distribution after some calculations taking in count flair - don't worry about this right now)\n\nIn other words, if someone tips you 1 DONUT in a comment you made in r/ethtrader and you are eligible and have registered a wallet, you get 330 DONUT back. That is 330x more than what you will get for commenting in other communities and it will literally takes seconds of effort. But this is not all, if you make a post, you are looking at 836 DONUT minus 250 Pay2Post which is still an insane return.\n\nFurthermore to prevent spam and stress, we added a rule to max the reward to **42500 DONUT** currently around **$169.41** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xroj43bbfgtf1.png?width=1291&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e73150cb631bd86731a98ecf32d37875a754ff0\n\nIn summary, people are out there commenting and posting for Internet Magic Points called karma while losing the chance to do both and also earn DONUT that can be converted to real money.\n\nMy advice is to hold them because selling has a penalization if you sell more than 25% (I think) and because DONUT price right now is really cheap so you can even make more.\n\nSo here is the idea, register a wallet address, start commenting, start posting and watch your DONUT bags grow. **And of course always try to share quality content and don't spam**. Just enjoy the community with one account and I assure you that your future will be better.\n\n# \ud83e\ude99 How to make others earn DONUT\n\nThis one is simple, if you want to reward someone's comment or post because you liked it or feel like it deserves it you just need to write the following command in the comment replacing NUMBER by the amount you want to tip\n\n`!tip NUMBER`\n\nIts important to say that this tips will be deducted from the ones you will earn in the incoming distribution.

Some years ago I went through the process of trying to consolidate assets, and found that the official Wallet is now not active, and hunting for a new wallet then took a back foot.\n\nI have all the required info to get access to the wallet etc, but nowadays most wallets don\u2019t accept older wallet transfers due to the old wallet\u2019s lack of secure \u2018security\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m basically looking to see if anyone else has or was in the same boat, and what you did.\n\nPlease don\u2019t spam about your dodgy looking wallet.

{"id": "1nx9wlo", "title": "New to crypto, looking for advice on my small ETH position", "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m still relatively new to the crypto world and currently only holding a small portfolio, around $1,800 in total. The biggest chunk of that is Ethereum, sitting at about $830. My average buy-in was around $4,300, which obviously isn\u2019t great. I basically bought near the top without much strategy. That being said, I\u2019m trying to learn and figure out a better plan for the future.\n\nRight now I also hold some Solana and XRP as my other two main positions. Nothing crazy, but they\u2019re the coins I felt somewhat comfortable with at this stage. I also have a tiny meme bag just for fun, but ETH is by far the largest part of my portfolio.\n\nHere\u2019s my actual question: does it make sense to sell my ETH position towards the end of this year, November or December, and then try to buy back in during a potential correction or dip next year? Or is that just trying to time the market, which everyone says is a bad idea, and I should just hold what I\u2019ve got?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my plan for 2026 is to invest much more seriously into both BTC and ETH. This current portfolio is really just a starting point. I don\u2019t mind holding for years, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to reposition better if there\u2019s a dip coming.\n\nWould love to hear what more experienced traders and investors here would do in my situation. Thanks a lot in advance for your perspectives, I really appreciate the input.\n\nTL;DR: New to crypto, small $1.8k portfolio, most in ETH bought at $4.3k avg.

But as materkel.eth explained it on Twitter, that myth needs to die. What is true in 2025 is clear: it is faster, cheaper and smarter to deploy a Layer 2 on Ethereum than to create a brand-new L1.\n\nThe math should be self-explanatory, data across the Ethereum network shows L2 transactions costing between $0.01 and $0.10 while L1 fees stay higher. Besides that maintaining an independent L1 means constant work on validators, security and upgrades. L2 teams escape most of that and only work on their product and incentives, the things that are actually bringing in users. Community sentiment evolved too, instead of rival chains discussion now centers on Ethereum's 'superchain' model, where different interconnected L2's reinforce one another while still benefiting from the security of Ethereum. That shared trust layer keeps the whole network stronger, not weaker.\n\nGoing back to the tweet posted by materkel, his view is that any sane CTO will launch an L2. With speed, cost and product attention being the highest values in this world, building yet another L1 is not innovation.. it is distraction.\n\nSource: https://x.com/materkel/status/1973710778092970096", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 12:33:27", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwxv7p/launching_a_new_l1_today_is_like_starting_a_new/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14431818181818185}

These reserves are falling again and every time this has happened before its been the calm before a massive rally.\n\nAccording to the Tweet and the chart:\n\n* **2020-2021:** ETH reserves dropped from 16M to 10M while price barely moved. At that time gas fees were sky high , the network was congested and most of the traders were asleep. Then demand suddenly pumped thanks to events like the UNI airdrop and ETH exploded from \\~$400 to nearly $4,800.\n* **2022-2023:** This time another huge outflow happened. This time from 15M to 9M ETH. This happened during the deep in the bear market, FTX was collapsing, banks were failing but supply quietly bled off exchanges. Once macro conditions improved, ETH rocketed from \\~$1,100 to \\~$4,000.\n* **2024-2025 (Now):** We are currently sitting at historic lows (\\~9.2M ETH) while price is around $4000-$4,500. This means ETH is being accumulated and pulled off exchanges, even if price is not exploding yet.\n\nThis is important because supply leaving exchanges is like draining a bathtub while the tap is still running. If buyers keep coming and sellers eventually run dry, the result is explosive and the price surges because there is simply nothing left to sell and buyers still want it.\n\nLower interest rates, expanding liquidity, institutional money flowing back in. history suggests we are on the verge of another violent rally.\n\nIt's time to explore uncharted territory with ETH price.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482)", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 06:27:59", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwrm8k/ethereum_supply_is_drying_up_fast_and_every_time/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.06831349206349209}

That kind of climb tends to stick better than a straight-line spike. If we start closing days above 4.5k and treating 4.2\u20134.3k as a buyable dip, my base case shifts from \u201crange with wicks\u201d to \u201ctrend with shallow pullbacks.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not leaning on patterns alone. The checklist I care about is spot > futures, funding and basis staying reasonable, and dips getting absorbed without cascading liquidations. If we see that, the path to retesting prior highs isn\u2019t fantasy. If, instead, we get perma-positive funding and a wide futures premium while spot flows fade, that\u2019s a caution flag.\n\nOn chain, I\u2019m watching the boring plumbing: L2 activity and fees trending up but not choking, stablecoin velocity actually used in DeFi vs just sitting, and staking flows remaining steady. None of these are moon signals by themselves, but together they separate healthy momentum from froth.\n\nWhat would invalidate the bull read for me? A weekly close back below 4.0\u20134.1k with rising open interest and heavy long skew would look like trapped chase longs. In that case, it\u2019s back to range until proven otherwise.\n\nMy plan is simple: let price prove it above 4.5k on closes, size positions so a normal pullback doesn\u2019t wreck the thesis, and avoid chasing candles on headline days. Curious whereu guys stand....are you already positioned for continuation, or waiting for that clean confirmation before pressing risk?\n\nAlso prepping for tax season early this year since last April was a mess.

But reality is different, it is important in what context it happens and usually the context matters more than the cut itself.\n\nAccording to some historical data that shows the Goldman Sachs research, when the Fed reduces rates outside of a recession, the S&P 500 (probably crypto too now) has historically delivered impressive results with gaining around 50% within two years of the first rate cut. This happens when inflation is cooling, growth remain stable and monetary policy is shifting from restrictive to supportive. Market understands these moves as a green light for risk assets (crypto).\n\nHowever the story changes dramatically when rate cuts happen during a recession. In those cases the S&P 500 tends to fall, around 20%-30% because economic weakness overshadows the impact of lower borrowing costs. In this case COVID era cuts were an exception.\n\nIn summary\n\n* If the Fed cut because the economy is collapsing, risk assets suffer.\n* If the Fed cut because inflation is easing without a growth crisis, markets usually soar.\n\nCurrently the US economy is not in a recession and inflation continues to cool, meaning that this cycle could look more like 1995 or 2019 periods that brought us strong market rallies rather than painful downturns like in 2001 and 2008.\n\nRate cuts are powerful, but only in the right economic environment.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/techconcatalina/status/1973528164799267055](https://x.com/techconcatalina/status/1973528164799267055)", "created_utc": "2025-10-02 06:19:29", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nvw580/rate_cuts_could_ignite_massive_rallies_why/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14889455782312927}

Rewards will switch from uptime-based to performance-based, meaning your earnings depend on how much useful compute your node provides. There\u2019ll also be upgraded dashboards, monitoring tools, and more control over your node setup.\n\nI really like where this is going \u2014 it feels like Ocean is evolving from a community experiment into something close to a decentralized AI cloud. Sure, we\u2019re all impatient to see it live, but the direction looks solid.\n\nWhat do you all think? Do you see this model actually competing with centralized compute providers someday?

Historically, each cycle has stretched a bit longer (\\~ 0.5 year), so BTC could have \\~0.5 year left to run, it needs to spend time in that 80-100 band before peaking.\n\nLevels to watch:\n\nOnce BTC clears the 60 risk area decisively, the model points to the 70s risk zone next, roughly $147K on my Dynamic Risk Range.\n\nBottom line: I\u2019m looking for sustained time in 80-100 before calling a cycle top.

{"id": "1o06rpc", "title": "What will Privacy in Crypto look like in 10 years?", "selftext": "With crypto, having an open ledger is both its greatest strength and its biggest flaw. The transparency that allows anyone to verify transactions and trust the blockchain without intermediaries also means that every payment, trade, or wallet movement is visible to the world for all time. While this openness builds security and accountability, it strips away a fundamental layer of personal privacy that traditional finance still protects. As crypto adoption grows, we have seen several options evolve for privacy. In the last 7 days, privacy crypto has boomed considerably. What are the main players and options out there?\n\n1. Privacy First Native Blockchain - The most well known here is Monero (XMR). This method achieves privacy by default using cryptographic primitives like ring signatures to obscure sender among a set, stealth addresses so recipients\u2019 addresses are not publicly visible, and Ring Confidential Transactions hide amounts. The real advantage here is privacy is inherent. However, because Monero is strongly private, it tends to attract suspicion from regulators as being a tool for illicit activity. There are also limitations around DeFi smart contract capabilities.\n2. Decentralised Mixers - The biggest here is Tornado Cash (TORN). This works by users deposit ing ETH or ERC-20 tokens into a pool, wait a while, and then withdraw to a different address. The zero knowledge proof shows a depositor has the right to withdraw without revealing which deposit is theirs. The benefit here is in the simplicity however, again, sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 but then lifted in March 2025 as deemed unenforcable. Also you can see pool visibility so regulators can blacklist addresses that interact with it.\n3. On-chain privacy tooling - Railgun (RAIL) is the most notable, being used and backed by Vitalik Buterin. This process again works though utilisation of zero knowledge proofs across all EVM chains (Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.) and because of this it sits on-chain and works with existing EVM networks, users don\u2019t need to move assets off chain or into side networks. Technology wise, this is the most advanced. The down side is potential regulatory changes and in terms of when funds enter or exit the shielded pool, there may still be traces or timing heuristics.\n\nI personally think there is a future for all three.

From my understand Hype was taking A TON of perp volume from Binance resulting in Binance arguably not being happy.\n\nThis lead to Binance Labs and CZ backing a perp DEX called Aster\n\n[https:\\/\\/x.com\\/cz\\_binance\\/status\\/1912414352969212139](https://preview.redd.it/tzaa6qi08mtf1.png?width=405&format=png&auto=webp&s=97fc6810b8a0a8233ed7bda3c31a37bbb46a2386)\n\nThis platform launched a token a few weeks ago and since they did CZ has been non stop pumping Aster. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sg0zt8ef8mtf1.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=244b6ee1d2a54d2b423e177822f72949778bb22c\n\nIn fact you might have heard of a post yesterday from defi lama that accused BNB of working with Aster to wash trade for volume. [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nz2b34/defillama_delists_aster_from_website_after/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t03ogkcn3mtf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7229dd373db3300e87c1c9907705c819f813a2a1\n\nFrom the available evidence it seems clear **AT THE VERY LEAST** BNB/CZ doesn't like Hype as it take potential revenue and they are working to some extent with a competing leverage DEX to steal marketshare and redirect those traders back into platforms where Binance has a hand in the pot.\n\nBut that's only half the story. The other half is in Hypes price chart. Hype has been unable to hold any recovery gains since this all started while Bitcoin keeps climbing and hitting new ATHs. Hype is currently exactly where it was when Bitcoin was 112k just ten days ago. With any Bitcoin fueled Hype rally just as quickly being sold off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itq0a2xn4mtf1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=1958a78f080183ff1c929a1a6a5b18ef5e8bf161\n\nFrom what I've been thinking someone with enough money could suppress price discovery of Hype while Bitcoin goes for a brand new ATH. Then when Bitcoin 'eventually' naturally retraces Hype along with other alts will likely drop more and they could close short leverage positions in profit. It's not a sure thing but it seems like a strategic bet if we assume price and profit has to do with users and fees.\n\nSo my question is, is this movement the result of a local bubble or is it something CZ Binance and CO have something to do with?", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 04:08:06", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o04snj/is_the_hype_token_being_crimed_by_cz_binance_or/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.04759740259740259}

It\u2019s not even about the money, it\u2019s about the feeling that i\u2019m giving up at the worst possible moment. I\u2019ve held some positions through every kind of market condition, from huge runs to brutal crashes, because I believed in what they stood for. They felt real, built on something solid, and that made it hard to let go even when the market clearly didn\u2019t care.  \n  \nStill, it\u2019s hard not to question myself when other trades go wrong. My best trade ever was one I entered on a random hunch and it ended up being the biggest win I\u2019ve ever had. Then came another one that turned into a disaster, just constant bleeding, new lows every week, and no sign of recovery. I told myself I don\u2019t sell cheap, but sometimes holding feels like pretending something still has life when it\u2019s clearly gone.  \n  \nLately I\u2019ve been trying to see selling differently. Maybe it\u2019s not about quitting or being weak, maybe it\u2019s just part of staying sane in a market that never really stops moving. Some trades work out, others don\u2019t, and the real challenge for me is knowing which ones still deserve my patience. I still hate selling cheap, even atm i saw aster trending on cmc i checked on bitget and saw it added to my portfolio. But the price still looks cheap in my eyes but I\u2019m starting to think that holding for pride costs more than taking the loss ever will.", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 14:38:42", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nzkv9p/i_hate_selling_cheap/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": -0.04174318947046218}

A similar analysis was done on the S&P 500.  The underlying assumption was, \"what if I suck at investing and only invested at market peaks?\"  The short answer is, 'you still make money'. \n\nI am attempting to replicate this for BTC (this is what happens when I drink).\n\nAssumptions\n\n* Assume you DCA $20 per week.\n* Assume you suck at investing and due to FOMO, you only buy at 'market highs'\n* Assume you suck so much that you purchase at the highest price during that day.\n* All numbers are USD\n\n**Method**: I pulled all data for BTC on a weekly basis.  I buy at the highest price on the given day and only if that is a 'new market high'.  First buy is $20 USD on 1/1/2017.  It takes 7 weeks to hit the next high, so I invest that $140 at the new 'high price'.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cuidsmtsqktf1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=d43054595173065cc302b105cc807bc9bd7036c0\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe table below reflects if you started this $20 DCA strategy in January of each year.  If you started in 2017, your total investment from 2017 through 2025 would be 9,100.  Your BTC would be valued at $80.7K.

{"id": "1nzfipg", "title": "Why stagflation and Fed rate cuts point toward owning assets like Ethereum.", "selftext": "So the U.S. economy is getting into uncharted territory, the Kobeissi Letter summed it up pretty well on Twitter: rate cuts are happening while core inflation is still a little over 2.9%. This is something that has not been seen in 30 years. Also on top of this the labor market outlook is getting weaker, deficit spending is well over $2 trillion annually and even jobs reports are on hold because of the government shutdown. And.. the Fed is not finished yet. Two more cuts are expected this year even as the U.S. is fighting against stagflation, slow growth mixed with high inflation. In the meantime tech giants are pouring over $100 billion every quarter into AI showing just how uneven the economy has become.\n\nWhat does this mean for us regular people?? Well the message is clear: hold assets or get left behind. Cash loses value when inflation stays sticky. Traditional bonds do not keep up when rates fall faster than prices. Assets that have independence from government policy, like ETH, stand out in this environment. As we all know well ETH is no longer just a speculative bet, it is increasingly being used as a reserve and settlement layer by institutions. If stagflation is here as it would seem then the old rule applies again: hard assets are the winner.. and for many more investors ETH is one of them.\n\nSource: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974092991842132271", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 10:39:01", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nzfipg/why_stagflation_and_fed_rate_cuts_point_toward/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.02591666666666667}
{"id": "1nzdxg8", "title": "Stop Sleeping: People Are Missing Out on Easy DONUT Gains", "selftext": "Okay, lets get real for a second guys, people are sleeping on the DONUT game being played here at r/ethtrader and I am just going to show you why.\n\nIf you have been casually commenting or posting in r/ethtrader community, you might not realize that you can earn a good chunk of DONUT without even breaking a sweat.\n\nLet's share some data from [last distribution cycle ](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nql0b2/donut_distribution_data_for_round_154_final_csv/)\n\n* **Max DONUT you can earn:** 42,500\n* **Comment ratio:** 330.22 per tip (from a full weight user - dont worry about this right now)\n* **Post ratio:** 836.64 per post\n* **Pay2post ratio:** 250 DONUT (fee deducted from your final distribution after some calculations taking in count flair - don't worry about this right now)\n\nIn other words, if someone tips you 1 DONUT in a comment you made in r/ethtrader and you are eligible and have registered a wallet, you get 330 DONUT back. That is 330x more than what you will get for commenting in other communities and it will literally takes seconds of effort. But this is not all, if you make a post, you are looking at 836 DONUT minus 250 Pay2Post which is still an insane return.\n\nFurthermore to prevent spam and stress, we added a rule to max the reward to **42500 DONUT** currently around **$169.41** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xroj43bbfgtf1.png?width=1291&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e73150cb631bd86731a98ecf32d37875a754ff0\n\nIn summary, people are out there commenting and posting for Internet Magic Points called karma while losing the chance to do both and also earn DONUT that can be converted to real money.\n\nMy advice is to hold them because selling has a penalization if you sell more than 25% (I think) and because DONUT price right now is really cheap so you can even make more.\n\nSo here is the idea, register a wallet address, start commenting, start posting and watch your DONUT bags grow. **And of course always try to share quality content and don't spam**. Just enjoy the community with one account and I assure you that your future will be better.\n\n# \ud83e\ude99 How to make others earn DONUT\n\nThis one is simple, if you want to reward someone's comment or post because you liked it or feel like it deserves it you just need to write the following command in the comment replacing NUMBER by the amount you want to tip\n\n`!tip NUMBER`\n\nIts important to say that this tips will be deducted from the ones you will earn in the incoming distribution. Same with pay to post and even if you end in negative no one will make you pay them.\n\n# \ud83d\udc5b How to register a wallet address\n\nYou can just comment the following command replacing wallet address by yours and you will register\n\n`!register <wallet address>`\n\nOr you can do it in [https://donutdao.org/](https://donutdao.org/) (scroll to the bottom to see the register part)\n\n# \ud83c\udfea How to Buy DONUT\n\nEven thought the team is working hard to get DONUT listed in a CEX (DONUT had an audit to improve the chances to be listed) we still are only on DEX.

Some years ago I went through the process of trying to consolidate assets, and found that the official Wallet is now not active, and hunting for a new wallet then took a back foot.\n\nI have all the required info to get access to the wallet etc, but nowadays most wallets don\u2019t accept older wallet transfers due to the old wallet\u2019s lack of secure \u2018security\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m basically looking to see if anyone else has or was in the same boat, and what you did.\n\nPlease don\u2019t spam about your dodgy looking wallet.

{"id": "1nx9wlo", "title": "New to crypto, looking for advice on my small ETH position", "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m still relatively new to the crypto world and currently only holding a small portfolio, around $1,800 in total. The biggest chunk of that is Ethereum, sitting at about $830. My average buy-in was around $4,300, which obviously isn\u2019t great. I basically bought near the top without much strategy. That being said, I\u2019m trying to learn and figure out a better plan for the future.\n\nRight now I also hold some Solana and XRP as my other two main positions. Nothing crazy, but they\u2019re the coins I felt somewhat comfortable with at this stage. I also have a tiny meme bag just for fun, but ETH is by far the largest part of my portfolio.\n\nHere\u2019s my actual question: does it make sense to sell my ETH position towards the end of this year, November or December, and then try to buy back in during a potential correction or dip next year? Or is that just trying to time the market, which everyone says is a bad idea, and I should just hold what I\u2019ve got?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my plan for 2026 is to invest much more seriously into both BTC and ETH. This current portfolio is really just a starting point. I don\u2019t mind holding for years, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to reposition better if there\u2019s a dip coming.\n\nWould love to hear what more experienced traders and investors here would do in my situation. Thanks a lot in advance for your perspectives, I really appreciate the input.\n\nTL;DR: New to crypto, small $1.8k portfolio, most in ETH bought at $4.3k avg.

But as materkel.eth explained it on Twitter, that myth needs to die. What is true in 2025 is clear: it is faster, cheaper and smarter to deploy a Layer 2 on Ethereum than to create a brand-new L1.\n\nThe math should be self-explanatory, data across the Ethereum network shows L2 transactions costing between $0.01 and $0.10 while L1 fees stay higher. Besides that maintaining an independent L1 means constant work on validators, security and upgrades. L2 teams escape most of that and only work on their product and incentives, the things that are actually bringing in users. Community sentiment evolved too, instead of rival chains discussion now centers on Ethereum's 'superchain' model, where different interconnected L2's reinforce one another while still benefiting from the security of Ethereum. That shared trust layer keeps the whole network stronger, not weaker.\n\nGoing back to the tweet posted by materkel, his view is that any sane CTO will launch an L2. With speed, cost and product attention being the highest values in this world, building yet another L1 is not innovation.. it is distraction.\n\nSource: https://x.com/materkel/status/1973710778092970096", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 12:33:27", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwxv7p/launching_a_new_l1_today_is_like_starting_a_new/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14431818181818185}

These reserves are falling again and every time this has happened before its been the calm before a massive rally.\n\nAccording to the Tweet and the chart:\n\n* **2020-2021:** ETH reserves dropped from 16M to 10M while price barely moved. At that time gas fees were sky high , the network was congested and most of the traders were asleep. Then demand suddenly pumped thanks to events like the UNI airdrop and ETH exploded from \\~$400 to nearly $4,800.\n* **2022-2023:** This time another huge outflow happened. This time from 15M to 9M ETH. This happened during the deep in the bear market, FTX was collapsing, banks were failing but supply quietly bled off exchanges. Once macro conditions improved, ETH rocketed from \\~$1,100 to \\~$4,000.\n* **2024-2025 (Now):** We are currently sitting at historic lows (\\~9.2M ETH) while price is around $4000-$4,500. This means ETH is being accumulated and pulled off exchanges, even if price is not exploding yet.\n\nThis is important because supply leaving exchanges is like draining a bathtub while the tap is still running. If buyers keep coming and sellers eventually run dry, the result is explosive and the price surges because there is simply nothing left to sell and buyers still want it.\n\nLower interest rates, expanding liquidity, institutional money flowing back in. history suggests we are on the verge of another violent rally.\n\nIt's time to explore uncharted territory with ETH price.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482)", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 06:27:59", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwrm8k/ethereum_supply_is_drying_up_fast_and_every_time/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.06831349206349209}

That kind of climb tends to stick better than a straight-line spike. If we start closing days above 4.5k and treating 4.2\u20134.3k as a buyable dip, my base case shifts from \u201crange with wicks\u201d to \u201ctrend with shallow pullbacks.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not leaning on patterns alone. The checklist I care about is spot > futures, funding and basis staying reasonable, and dips getting absorbed without cascading liquidations. If we see that, the path to retesting prior highs isn\u2019t fantasy. If, instead, we get perma-positive funding and a wide futures premium while spot flows fade, that\u2019s a caution flag.\n\nOn chain, I\u2019m watching the boring plumbing: L2 activity and fees trending up but not choking, stablecoin velocity actually used in DeFi vs just sitting, and staking flows remaining steady. None of these are moon signals by themselves, but together they separate healthy momentum from froth.\n\nWhat would invalidate the bull read for me? A weekly close back below 4.0\u20134.1k with rising open interest and heavy long skew would look like trapped chase longs. In that case, it\u2019s back to range until proven otherwise.\n\nMy plan is simple: let price prove it above 4.5k on closes, size positions so a normal pullback doesn\u2019t wreck the thesis, and avoid chasing candles on headline days. Curious whereu guys stand....are you already positioned for continuation, or waiting for that clean confirmation before pressing risk?\n\nAlso prepping for tax season early this year since last April was a mess.

But reality is different, it is important in what context it happens and usually the context matters more than the cut itself.\n\nAccording to some historical data that shows the Goldman Sachs research, when the Fed reduces rates outside of a recession, the S&P 500 (probably crypto too now) has historically delivered impressive results with gaining around 50% within two years of the first rate cut. This happens when inflation is cooling, growth remain stable and monetary policy is shifting from restrictive to supportive. Market understands these moves as a green light for risk assets (crypto).\n\nHowever the story changes dramatically when rate cuts happen during a recession. In those cases the S&P 500 tends to fall, around 20%-30% because economic weakness overshadows the impact of lower borrowing costs. In this case COVID era cuts were an exception.\n\nIn summary\n\n* If the Fed cut because the economy is collapsing, risk assets suffer.\n* If the Fed cut because inflation is easing without a growth crisis, markets usually soar.\n\nCurrently the US economy is not in a recession and inflation continues to cool, meaning that this cycle could look more like 1995 or 2019 periods that brought us strong market rallies rather than painful downturns like in 2001 and 2008.\n\nRate cuts are powerful, but only in the right economic environment.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/techconcatalina/status/1973528164799267055](https://x.com/techconcatalina/status/1973528164799267055)", "created_utc": "2025-10-02 06:19:29", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nvw580/rate_cuts_could_ignite_massive_rallies_why/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14889455782312927}

The first phase proved that decentralized compute can actually work and scale beyond expectations.\n\nNow, everyone\u2019s waiting on Phase 2, which was expected to kick off around September, but it seems we\u2019re still in the prep and testing stage. The Ocean team is running GPU benchmark jobs to evaluate performance and stability before going fully live. It\u2019s a smart move \u2014 this next step isn\u2019t just about keeping nodes online, it\u2019s about real compute power.\n\nPhase 2 will focus on GPU-based workloads like model training, fine-tuning, and AI tasks that actually use serious resources. Rewards will switch from uptime-based to performance-based, meaning your earnings depend on how much useful compute your node provides. There\u2019ll also be upgraded dashboards, monitoring tools, and more control over your node setup.\n\nI really like where this is going \u2014 it feels like Ocean is evolving from a community experiment into something close to a decentralized AI cloud.

{"id": "1o06rpc", "title": "What will Privacy in Crypto look like in 10 years?", "selftext": "With crypto, having an open ledger is both its greatest strength and its biggest flaw. The transparency that allows anyone to verify transactions and trust the blockchain without intermediaries also means that every payment, trade, or wallet movement is visible to the world for all time. While this openness builds security and accountability, it strips away a fundamental layer of personal privacy that traditional finance still protects. As crypto adoption grows, we have seen several options evolve for privacy. In the last 7 days, privacy crypto has boomed considerably. What are the main players and options out there?\n\n1. Privacy First Native Blockchain - The most well known here is Monero (XMR). This method achieves privacy by default using cryptographic primitives like ring signatures to obscure sender among a set, stealth addresses so recipients\u2019 addresses are not publicly visible, and Ring Confidential Transactions hide amounts. The real advantage here is privacy is inherent. However, because Monero is strongly private, it tends to attract suspicion from regulators as being a tool for illicit activity. There are also limitations around DeFi smart contract capabilities.\n2. Decentralised Mixers - The biggest here is Tornado Cash (TORN). This works by users deposit ing ETH or ERC-20 tokens into a pool, wait a while, and then withdraw to a different address. The zero knowledge proof shows a depositor has the right to withdraw without revealing which deposit is theirs. The benefit here is in the simplicity however, again, sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 but then lifted in March 2025 as deemed unenforcable. Also you can see pool visibility so regulators can blacklist addresses that interact with it.\n3. On-chain privacy tooling - Railgun (RAIL) is the most notable, being used and backed by Vitalik Buterin. This process again works though utilisation of zero knowledge proofs across all EVM chains (Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.) and because of this it sits on-chain and works with existing EVM networks, users don\u2019t need to move assets off chain or into side networks. Technology wise, this is the most advanced. The down side is potential regulatory changes and in terms of when funds enter or exit the shielded pool, there may still be traces or timing heuristics.\n\nI personally think there is a future for all three. However, I think Monero has largely reached its potential. Based on market cap, I see the biggest growth in Railgun and Tornado Cash.\n\nWhat do you think privacy in crypto will look like in the next 5-10 years?\n\n\\*Edit: Updated to include lift of sanctions", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 06:00:36", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o06rpc/what_will_privacy_in_crypto_look_like_in_10_years/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.19197845804988664}

From my understand Hype was taking A TON of perp volume from Binance resulting in Binance arguably not being happy.\n\nThis lead to Binance Labs and CZ backing a perp DEX called Aster\n\n[https:\\/\\/x.com\\/cz\\_binance\\/status\\/1912414352969212139](https://preview.redd.it/tzaa6qi08mtf1.png?width=405&format=png&auto=webp&s=97fc6810b8a0a8233ed7bda3c31a37bbb46a2386)\n\nThis platform launched a token a few weeks ago and since they did CZ has been non stop pumping Aster. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sg0zt8ef8mtf1.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=244b6ee1d2a54d2b423e177822f72949778bb22c\n\nIn fact you might have heard of a post yesterday from defi lama that accused BNB of working with Aster to wash trade for volume. [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nz2b34/defillama_delists_aster_from_website_after/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t03ogkcn3mtf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7229dd373db3300e87c1c9907705c819f813a2a1\n\nFrom the available evidence it seems clear **AT THE VERY LEAST** BNB/CZ doesn't like Hype as it take potential revenue and they are working to some extent with a competing leverage DEX to steal marketshare and redirect those traders back into platforms where Binance has a hand in the pot.\n\nBut that's only half the story. The other half is in Hypes price chart. Hype has been unable to hold any recovery gains since this all started while Bitcoin keeps climbing and hitting new ATHs. Hype is currently exactly where it was when Bitcoin was 112k just ten days ago. With any Bitcoin fueled Hype rally just as quickly being sold off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itq0a2xn4mtf1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=1958a78f080183ff1c929a1a6a5b18ef5e8bf161\n\nFrom what I've been thinking someone with enough money could suppress price discovery of Hype while Bitcoin goes for a brand new ATH. Then when Bitcoin 'eventually' naturally retraces Hype along with other alts will likely drop more and they could close short leverage positions in profit. It's not a sure thing but it seems like a strategic bet if we assume price and profit has to do with users and fees.\n\nSo my question is, is this movement the result of a local bubble or is it something CZ Binance and CO have something to do with?", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 04:08:06", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o04snj/is_the_hype_token_being_crimed_by_cz_binance_or/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.04759740259740259}

This is something that has not been seen in 30 years. Also on top of this the labor market outlook is getting weaker, deficit spending is well over $2 trillion annually and even jobs reports are on hold because of the government shutdown. And.. the Fed is not finished yet. Two more cuts are expected this year even as the U.S. is fighting against stagflation, slow growth mixed with high inflation. In the meantime tech giants are pouring over $100 billion every quarter into AI showing just how uneven the economy has become.\n\nWhat does this mean for us regular people?? Well the message is clear: hold assets or get left behind. Cash loses value when inflation stays sticky. Traditional bonds do not keep up when rates fall faster than prices. Assets that have independence from government policy, like ETH, stand out in this environment. As we all know well ETH is no longer just a speculative bet, it is increasingly being used as a reserve and settlement layer by institutions. If stagflation is here as it would seem then the old rule applies again: hard assets are the winner.. and for many more investors ETH is one of them.\n\nSource: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974092991842132271", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 10:39:01", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nzfipg/why_stagflation_and_fed_rate_cuts_point_toward/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.02591666666666667}

I appreciate that this is one of those danger danger type posts, but I\u2019ll go for it anyway.\n\nBack in the glory days of mining Ethereum I set up an official Ethereum Wallet. I sat on the mining proceeds for years and haven\u2019t touched them for over 8 years. Some years ago I went through the process of trying to consolidate assets, and found that the official Wallet is now not active, and hunting for a new wallet then took a back foot.\n\nI have all the required info to get access to the wallet etc, but nowadays most wallets don\u2019t accept older wallet transfers due to the old wallet\u2019s lack of secure \u2018security\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m basically looking to see if anyone else has or was in the same boat, and what you did.\n\nPlease don\u2019t spam about your dodgy looking wallet. I of course will be doing due diligence on any info I obtain here. \n\nI\u2019m struggling to hit the word limit here so apologies for the rambling and random additional comments. I just need to hit that glorious 200 word limit in order to post.

Phase 1 wrapped up this summer and honestly, the numbers were insane \u2014 over 1.7 million nodes deployed across 70+ countries. That\u2019s not small-scale testing anymore, that\u2019s real global reach. The first phase proved that decentralized compute can actually work and scale beyond expectations.\n\nNow, everyone\u2019s waiting on Phase 2, which was expected to kick off around September, but it seems we\u2019re still in the prep and testing stage. The Ocean team is running GPU benchmark jobs to evaluate performance and stability before going fully live. It\u2019s a smart move \u2014 this next step isn\u2019t just about keeping nodes online, it\u2019s about real compute power.\n\nPhase 2 will focus on GPU-based workloads like model training, fine-tuning, and AI tasks that actually use serious resources. Rewards will switch from uptime-based to performance-based, meaning your earnings depend on how much useful compute your node provides. There\u2019ll also be upgraded dashboards, monitoring tools, and more control over your node setup.\n\nI really like where this is going \u2014 it feels like Ocean is evolving from a community experiment into something close to a decentralized AI cloud. Sure, we\u2019re all impatient to see it live, but the direction looks solid.\n\nWhat do you all think? Do you see this model actually competing with centralized compute providers someday?

Since base Layer 1s cannot provide the required throughput, L2s (Stacks, Arbitrum, Optimism) are becoming the indispensable \"AI Payment Rails\".  \n\n2) Solana's Structural Edge: High-speed L1s like Solana are positioned favorably due to superior scalability and low cost. Citigroup's exploration of Solana confirms its technical viability for payments.  \n\n3) Revenue Model Shift: Trading platforms are moving from volatile transaction fees to stable income. Coinbase's profit is driven by subscription and staking revenue, while Robinhood monetizes engagement via prediction markets (2 billion contracts in Q3).  \n\nWill Solana's high-speed L1 architecture dominate the future of RWA/AI utility, or will the L2 ecosystem's fundamental security (built atop BTC/ETH) ultimately become the required institutional rail?", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 06:19:43", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o0734i/solana_vs_l2s_why_the_ai_agent_boom_just_made/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.13035714285714287}

But there is the argument that U.S dollar is declining, and that it's inflating, and fiat currency is a bottomless pit....\n\n  \nAnother option I been hearing alot lately is converting it all into stablecoins and just holding all profits in stablecoins. How do you feel about this route? Also, on the side note, which is the best stablecoin? Tether or USDC?\n\n  \nThe last option I can think of is just converting all profits into Bitcoin and just holding Bitcoin.  Not cashing anything to bank. Obviously alot of money will be saved because of tax reasons from this. Maybe one day you can buy a house or groceries with bitcoin lol.

The transparency that allows anyone to verify transactions and trust the blockchain without intermediaries also means that every payment, trade, or wallet movement is visible to the world for all time. While this openness builds security and accountability, it strips away a fundamental layer of personal privacy that traditional finance still protects. As crypto adoption grows, we have seen several options evolve for privacy. In the last 7 days, privacy crypto has boomed considerably. What are the main players and options out there?\n\n1. Privacy First Native Blockchain - The most well known here is Monero (XMR). This method achieves privacy by default using cryptographic primitives like ring signatures to obscure sender among a set, stealth addresses so recipients\u2019 addresses are not publicly visible, and Ring Confidential Transactions hide amounts. The real advantage here is privacy is inherent. However, because Monero is strongly private, it tends to attract suspicion from regulators as being a tool for illicit activity. There are also limitations around DeFi smart contract capabilities.\n2. Decentralised Mixers - The biggest here is Tornado Cash (TORN). This works by users deposit ing ETH or ERC-20 tokens into a pool, wait a while, and then withdraw to a different address. The zero knowledge proof shows a depositor has the right to withdraw without revealing which deposit is theirs. The benefit here is in the simplicity however, again, sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 but then lifted in March 2025 as deemed unenforcable. Also you can see pool visibility so regulators can blacklist addresses that interact with it.\n3. On-chain privacy tooling - Railgun (RAIL) is the most notable, being used and backed by Vitalik Buterin. This process again works though utilisation of zero knowledge proofs across all EVM chains (Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.) and because of this it sits on-chain and works with existing EVM networks, users don\u2019t need to move assets off chain or into side networks. Technology wise, this is the most advanced. The down side is potential regulatory changes and in terms of when funds enter or exit the shielded pool, there may still be traces or timing heuristics.\n\nI personally think there is a future for all three. However, I think Monero has largely reached its potential. Based on market cap, I see the biggest growth in Railgun and Tornado Cash.\n\nWhat do you think privacy in crypto will look like in the next 5-10 years?\n\n\\*Edit: Updated to include lift of sanctions", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 06:00:36", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o06rpc/what_will_privacy_in_crypto_look_like_in_10_years/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.19197845804988664}

{"id": "1nzfipg", "title": "Why stagflation and Fed rate cuts point toward owning assets like Ethereum.", "selftext": "So the U.S. economy is getting into uncharted territory, the Kobeissi Letter summed it up pretty well on Twitter: rate cuts are happening while core inflation is still a little over 2.9%. This is something that has not been seen in 30 years. Also on top of this the labor market outlook is getting weaker, deficit spending is well over $2 trillion annually and even jobs reports are on hold because of the government shutdown. And.. the Fed is not finished yet. Two more cuts are expected this year even as the U.S. is fighting against stagflation, slow growth mixed with high inflation. In the meantime tech giants are pouring over $100 billion every quarter into AI showing just how uneven the economy has become.\n\nWhat does this mean for us regular people?? Well the message is clear: hold assets or get left behind. Cash loses value when inflation stays sticky. Traditional bonds do not keep up when rates fall faster than prices. Assets that have independence from government policy, like ETH, stand out in this environment. As we all know well ETH is no longer just a speculative bet, it is increasingly being used as a reserve and settlement layer by institutions. If stagflation is here as it would seem then the old rule applies again: hard assets are the winner.. and for many more investors ETH is one of them.\n\nSource: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974092991842132271", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 10:39:01", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nzfipg/why_stagflation_and_fed_rate_cuts_point_toward/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.02591666666666667}
{"id": "1nzdxg8", "title": "Stop Sleeping: People Are Missing Out on Easy DONUT Gains", "selftext": "Okay, lets get real for a second guys, people are sleeping on the DONUT game being played here at r/ethtrader and I am just going to show you why.\n\nIf you have been casually commenting or posting in r/ethtrader community, you might not realize that you can earn a good chunk of DONUT without even breaking a sweat.\n\nLet's share some data from [last distribution cycle ](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nql0b2/donut_distribution_data_for_round_154_final_csv/)\n\n* **Max DONUT you can earn:** 42,500\n* **Comment ratio:** 330.22 per tip (from a full weight user - dont worry about this right now)\n* **Post ratio:** 836.64 per post\n* **Pay2post ratio:** 250 DONUT (fee deducted from your final distribution after some calculations taking in count flair - don't worry about this right now)\n\nIn other words, if someone tips you 1 DONUT in a comment you made in r/ethtrader and you are eligible and have registered a wallet, you get 330 DONUT back. That is 330x more than what you will get for commenting in other communities and it will literally takes seconds of effort. But this is not all, if you make a post, you are looking at 836 DONUT minus 250 Pay2Post which is still an insane return.\n\nFurthermore to prevent spam and stress, we added a rule to max the reward to **42500 DONUT** currently around **$169.41** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xroj43bbfgtf1.png?width=1291&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e73150cb631bd86731a98ecf32d37875a754ff0\n\nIn summary, people are out there commenting and posting for Internet Magic Points called karma while losing the chance to do both and also earn DONUT that can be converted to real money.\n\nMy advice is to hold them because selling has a penalization if you sell more than 25% (I think) and because DONUT price right now is really cheap so you can even make more.\n\nSo here is the idea, register a wallet address, start commenting, start posting and watch your DONUT bags grow. **And of course always try to share quality content and don't spam**. Just enjoy the community with one account and I assure you that your future will be better.\n\n# \ud83e\ude99 How to make others earn DONUT\n\nThis one is simple, if you want to reward someone's comment or post because you liked it or feel like it deserves it you just need to write the following command in the comment replacing NUMBER by the amount you want to tip\n\n`!tip NUMBER`\n\nIts important to say that this tips will be deducted from the ones you will earn in the incoming distribution. Same with pay to post and even if you end in negative no one will make you pay them.\n\n# \ud83d\udc5b How to register a wallet address\n\nYou can just comment the following command replacing wallet address by yours and you will register\n\n`!register <wallet address>`\n\nOr you can do it in [https://donutdao.org/](https://donutdao.org/) (scroll to the bottom to see the register part)\n\n# \ud83c\udfea How to Buy DONUT\n\nEven thought the team is working hard to get DONUT listed in a CEX (DONUT had an audit to improve the chances to be listed) we still are only on DEX.

The first phase proved that decentralized compute can actually work and scale beyond expectations.\n\nNow, everyone\u2019s waiting on Phase 2, which was expected to kick off around September, but it seems we\u2019re still in the prep and testing stage. The Ocean team is running GPU benchmark jobs to evaluate performance and stability before going fully live. It\u2019s a smart move \u2014 this next step isn\u2019t just about keeping nodes online, it\u2019s about real compute power.\n\nPhase 2 will focus on GPU-based workloads like model training, fine-tuning, and AI tasks that actually use serious resources. Rewards will switch from uptime-based to performance-based, meaning your earnings depend on how much useful compute your node provides. There\u2019ll also be upgraded dashboards, monitoring tools, and more control over your node setup.\n\nI really like where this is going \u2014 it feels like Ocean is evolving from a community experiment into something close to a decentralized AI cloud.

{"id": "1o06rpc", "title": "What will Privacy in Crypto look like in 10 years?", "selftext": "With crypto, having an open ledger is both its greatest strength and its biggest flaw. The transparency that allows anyone to verify transactions and trust the blockchain without intermediaries also means that every payment, trade, or wallet movement is visible to the world for all time. While this openness builds security and accountability, it strips away a fundamental layer of personal privacy that traditional finance still protects. As crypto adoption grows, we have seen several options evolve for privacy. In the last 7 days, privacy crypto has boomed considerably. What are the main players and options out there?\n\n1. Privacy First Native Blockchain - The most well known here is Monero (XMR). This method achieves privacy by default using cryptographic primitives like ring signatures to obscure sender among a set, stealth addresses so recipients\u2019 addresses are not publicly visible, and Ring Confidential Transactions hide amounts. The real advantage here is privacy is inherent. However, because Monero is strongly private, it tends to attract suspicion from regulators as being a tool for illicit activity. There are also limitations around DeFi smart contract capabilities.\n2. Decentralised Mixers - The biggest here is Tornado Cash (TORN). This works by users deposit ing ETH or ERC-20 tokens into a pool, wait a while, and then withdraw to a different address. The zero knowledge proof shows a depositor has the right to withdraw without revealing which deposit is theirs. The benefit here is in the simplicity however, again, sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 but then lifted in March 2025 as deemed unenforcable. Also you can see pool visibility so regulators can blacklist addresses that interact with it.\n3. On-chain privacy tooling - Railgun (RAIL) is the most notable, being used and backed by Vitalik Buterin. This process again works though utilisation of zero knowledge proofs across all EVM chains (Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.) and because of this it sits on-chain and works with existing EVM networks, users don\u2019t need to move assets off chain or into side networks. Technology wise, this is the most advanced. The down side is potential regulatory changes and in terms of when funds enter or exit the shielded pool, there may still be traces or timing heuristics.\n\nI personally think there is a future for all three. However, I think Monero has largely reached its potential. Based on market cap, I see the biggest growth in Railgun and Tornado Cash.\n\nWhat do you think privacy in crypto will look like in the next 5-10 years?\n\n\\*Edit: Updated to include lift of sanctions", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 06:00:36", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o06rpc/what_will_privacy_in_crypto_look_like_in_10_years/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.19197845804988664}

From my understand Hype was taking A TON of perp volume from Binance resulting in Binance arguably not being happy.\n\nThis lead to Binance Labs and CZ backing a perp DEX called Aster\n\n[https:\\/\\/x.com\\/cz\\_binance\\/status\\/1912414352969212139](https://preview.redd.it/tzaa6qi08mtf1.png?width=405&format=png&auto=webp&s=97fc6810b8a0a8233ed7bda3c31a37bbb46a2386)\n\nThis platform launched a token a few weeks ago and since they did CZ has been non stop pumping Aster. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sg0zt8ef8mtf1.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=244b6ee1d2a54d2b423e177822f72949778bb22c\n\nIn fact you might have heard of a post yesterday from defi lama that accused BNB of working with Aster to wash trade for volume. [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nz2b34/defillama_delists_aster_from_website_after/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t03ogkcn3mtf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7229dd373db3300e87c1c9907705c819f813a2a1\n\nFrom the available evidence it seems clear **AT THE VERY LEAST** BNB/CZ doesn't like Hype as it take potential revenue and they are working to some extent with a competing leverage DEX to steal marketshare and redirect those traders back into platforms where Binance has a hand in the pot.\n\nBut that's only half the story. The other half is in Hypes price chart. Hype has been unable to hold any recovery gains since this all started while Bitcoin keeps climbing and hitting new ATHs. Hype is currently exactly where it was when Bitcoin was 112k just ten days ago. With any Bitcoin fueled Hype rally just as quickly being sold off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itq0a2xn4mtf1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=1958a78f080183ff1c929a1a6a5b18ef5e8bf161\n\nFrom what I've been thinking someone with enough money could suppress price discovery of Hype while Bitcoin goes for a brand new ATH. Then when Bitcoin 'eventually' naturally retraces Hype along with other alts will likely drop more and they could close short leverage positions in profit. It's not a sure thing but it seems like a strategic bet if we assume price and profit has to do with users and fees.\n\nSo my question is, is this movement the result of a local bubble or is it something CZ Binance and CO have something to do with?", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 04:08:06", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o04snj/is_the_hype_token_being_crimed_by_cz_binance_or/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.04759740259740259}

{"id": "1nzfipg", "title": "Why stagflation and Fed rate cuts point toward owning assets like Ethereum.", "selftext": "So the U.S. economy is getting into uncharted territory, the Kobeissi Letter summed it up pretty well on Twitter: rate cuts are happening while core inflation is still a little over 2.9%. This is something that has not been seen in 30 years. Also on top of this the labor market outlook is getting weaker, deficit spending is well over $2 trillion annually and even jobs reports are on hold because of the government shutdown. And.. the Fed is not finished yet. Two more cuts are expected this year even as the U.S. is fighting against stagflation, slow growth mixed with high inflation. In the meantime tech giants are pouring over $100 billion every quarter into AI showing just how uneven the economy has become.\n\nWhat does this mean for us regular people?? Well the message is clear: hold assets or get left behind. Cash loses value when inflation stays sticky. Traditional bonds do not keep up when rates fall faster than prices. Assets that have independence from government policy, like ETH, stand out in this environment. As we all know well ETH is no longer just a speculative bet, it is increasingly being used as a reserve and settlement layer by institutions. If stagflation is here as it would seem then the old rule applies again: hard assets are the winner.. and for many more investors ETH is one of them.\n\nSource: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974092991842132271", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 10:39:01", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nzfipg/why_stagflation_and_fed_rate_cuts_point_toward/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.02591666666666667}

I appreciate that this is one of those danger danger type posts, but I\u2019ll go for it anyway.\n\nBack in the glory days of mining Ethereum I set up an official Ethereum Wallet. I sat on the mining proceeds for years and haven\u2019t touched them for over 8 years. Some years ago I went through the process of trying to consolidate assets, and found that the official Wallet is now not active, and hunting for a new wallet then took a back foot.\n\nI have all the required info to get access to the wallet etc, but nowadays most wallets don\u2019t accept older wallet transfers due to the old wallet\u2019s lack of secure \u2018security\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m basically looking to see if anyone else has or was in the same boat, and what you did.\n\nPlease don\u2019t spam about your dodgy looking wallet. I of course will be doing due diligence on any info I obtain here. \n\nI\u2019m struggling to hit the word limit here so apologies for the rambling and random additional comments. I just need to hit that glorious 200 word limit in order to post.

Phase 1 wrapped up this summer and honestly, the numbers were insane \u2014 over 1.7 million nodes deployed across 70+ countries. That\u2019s not small-scale testing anymore, that\u2019s real global reach. The first phase proved that decentralized compute can actually work and scale beyond expectations.\n\nNow, everyone\u2019s waiting on Phase 2, which was expected to kick off around September, but it seems we\u2019re still in the prep and testing stage. The Ocean team is running GPU benchmark jobs to evaluate performance and stability before going fully live. It\u2019s a smart move \u2014 this next step isn\u2019t just about keeping nodes online, it\u2019s about real compute power.\n\nPhase 2 will focus on GPU-based workloads like model training, fine-tuning, and AI tasks that actually use serious resources. Rewards will switch from uptime-based to performance-based, meaning your earnings depend on how much useful compute your node provides. There\u2019ll also be upgraded dashboards, monitoring tools, and more control over your node setup.\n\nI really like where this is going \u2014 it feels like Ocean is evolving from a community experiment into something close to a decentralized AI cloud. Sure, we\u2019re all impatient to see it live, but the direction looks solid.\n\nWhat do you all think? Do you see this model actually competing with centralized compute providers someday?

Since base Layer 1s cannot provide the required throughput, L2s (Stacks, Arbitrum, Optimism) are becoming the indispensable \"AI Payment Rails\".  \n\n2) Solana's Structural Edge: High-speed L1s like Solana are positioned favorably due to superior scalability and low cost.

{"id": "1o06rpc", "title": "What will Privacy in Crypto look like in 10 years?", "selftext": "With crypto, having an open ledger is both its greatest strength and its biggest flaw. The transparency that allows anyone to verify transactions and trust the blockchain without intermediaries also means that every payment, trade, or wallet movement is visible to the world for all time. While this openness builds security and accountability, it strips away a fundamental layer of personal privacy that traditional finance still protects. As crypto adoption grows, we have seen several options evolve for privacy. In the last 7 days, privacy crypto has boomed considerably. What are the main players and options out there?\n\n1. Privacy First Native Blockchain - The most well known here is Monero (XMR). This method achieves privacy by default using cryptographic primitives like ring signatures to obscure sender among a set, stealth addresses so recipients\u2019 addresses are not publicly visible, and Ring Confidential Transactions hide amounts. The real advantage here is privacy is inherent. However, because Monero is strongly private, it tends to attract suspicion from regulators as being a tool for illicit activity. There are also limitations around DeFi smart contract capabilities.\n2. Decentralised Mixers - The biggest here is Tornado Cash (TORN). This works by users deposit ing ETH or ERC-20 tokens into a pool, wait a while, and then withdraw to a different address. The zero knowledge proof shows a depositor has the right to withdraw without revealing which deposit is theirs. The benefit here is in the simplicity however, again, sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 but then lifted in March 2025 as deemed unenforcable. Also you can see pool visibility so regulators can blacklist addresses that interact with it.\n3. On-chain privacy tooling - Railgun (RAIL) is the most notable, being used and backed by Vitalik Buterin. This process again works though utilisation of zero knowledge proofs across all EVM chains (Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.) and because of this it sits on-chain and works with existing EVM networks, users don\u2019t need to move assets off chain or into side networks. Technology wise, this is the most advanced. The down side is potential regulatory changes and in terms of when funds enter or exit the shielded pool, there may still be traces or timing heuristics.\n\nI personally think there is a future for all three. However, I think Monero has largely reached its potential. Based on market cap, I see the biggest growth in Railgun and Tornado Cash.\n\nWhat do you think privacy in crypto will look like in the next 5-10 years?\n\n\\*Edit: Updated to include lift of sanctions", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 06:00:36", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o06rpc/what_will_privacy_in_crypto_look_like_in_10_years/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.19197845804988664}

{"id": "1nzfipg", "title": "Why stagflation and Fed rate cuts point toward owning assets like Ethereum.", "selftext": "So the U.S. economy is getting into uncharted territory, the Kobeissi Letter summed it up pretty well on Twitter: rate cuts are happening while core inflation is still a little over 2.9%. This is something that has not been seen in 30 years. Also on top of this the labor market outlook is getting weaker, deficit spending is well over $2 trillion annually and even jobs reports are on hold because of the government shutdown. And.. the Fed is not finished yet. Two more cuts are expected this year even as the U.S. is fighting against stagflation, slow growth mixed with high inflation. In the meantime tech giants are pouring over $100 billion every quarter into AI showing just how uneven the economy has become.\n\nWhat does this mean for us regular people?? Well the message is clear: hold assets or get left behind. Cash loses value when inflation stays sticky. Traditional bonds do not keep up when rates fall faster than prices. Assets that have independence from government policy, like ETH, stand out in this environment. As we all know well ETH is no longer just a speculative bet, it is increasingly being used as a reserve and settlement layer by institutions. If stagflation is here as it would seem then the old rule applies again: hard assets are the winner.. and for many more investors ETH is one of them.\n\nSource: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974092991842132271", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 10:39:01", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nzfipg/why_stagflation_and_fed_rate_cuts_point_toward/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.02591666666666667}

That is 330x more than what you will get for commenting in other communities and it will literally takes seconds of effort. But this is not all, if you make a post, you are looking at 836 DONUT minus 250 Pay2Post which is still an insane return.\n\nFurthermore to prevent spam and stress, we added a rule to max the reward to **42500 DONUT** currently around **$169.41** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xroj43bbfgtf1.png?width=1291&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e73150cb631bd86731a98ecf32d37875a754ff0\n\nIn summary, people are out there commenting and posting for Internet Magic Points called karma while losing the chance to do both and also earn DONUT that can be converted to real money.\n\nMy advice is to hold them because selling has a penalization if you sell more than 25% (I think) and because DONUT price right now is really cheap so you can even make more.\n\nSo here is the idea, register a wallet address, start commenting, start posting and watch your DONUT bags grow. **And of course always try to share quality content and don't spam**. Just enjoy the community with one account and I assure you that your future will be better.\n\n# \ud83e\ude99 How to make others earn DONUT\n\nThis one is simple, if you want to reward someone's comment or post because you liked it or feel like it deserves it you just need to write the following command in the comment replacing NUMBER by the amount you want to tip\n\n`!tip NUMBER`\n\nIts important to say that this tips will be deducted from the ones you will earn in the incoming distribution.

The first phase proved that decentralized compute can actually work and scale beyond expectations.\n\nNow, everyone\u2019s waiting on Phase 2, which was expected to kick off around September, but it seems we\u2019re still in the prep and testing stage. The Ocean team is running GPU benchmark jobs to evaluate performance and stability before going fully live. It\u2019s a smart move \u2014 this next step isn\u2019t just about keeping nodes online, it\u2019s about real compute power.\n\nPhase 2 will focus on GPU-based workloads like model training, fine-tuning, and AI tasks that actually use serious resources. Rewards will switch from uptime-based to performance-based, meaning your earnings depend on how much useful compute your node provides. There\u2019ll also be upgraded dashboards, monitoring tools, and more control over your node setup.\n\nI really like where this is going \u2014 it feels like Ocean is evolving from a community experiment into something close to a decentralized AI cloud.

{"id": "1o06rpc", "title": "What will Privacy in Crypto look like in 10 years?", "selftext": "With crypto, having an open ledger is both its greatest strength and its biggest flaw. The transparency that allows anyone to verify transactions and trust the blockchain without intermediaries also means that every payment, trade, or wallet movement is visible to the world for all time. While this openness builds security and accountability, it strips away a fundamental layer of personal privacy that traditional finance still protects. As crypto adoption grows, we have seen several options evolve for privacy. In the last 7 days, privacy crypto has boomed considerably. What are the main players and options out there?\n\n1. Privacy First Native Blockchain - The most well known here is Monero (XMR). This method achieves privacy by default using cryptographic primitives like ring signatures to obscure sender among a set, stealth addresses so recipients\u2019 addresses are not publicly visible, and Ring Confidential Transactions hide amounts. The real advantage here is privacy is inherent. However, because Monero is strongly private, it tends to attract suspicion from regulators as being a tool for illicit activity. There are also limitations around DeFi smart contract capabilities.\n2. Decentralised Mixers - The biggest here is Tornado Cash (TORN). This works by users deposit ing ETH or ERC-20 tokens into a pool, wait a while, and then withdraw to a different address. The zero knowledge proof shows a depositor has the right to withdraw without revealing which deposit is theirs. The benefit here is in the simplicity however, again, sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 but then lifted in March 2025 as deemed unenforcable. Also you can see pool visibility so regulators can blacklist addresses that interact with it.\n3. On-chain privacy tooling - Railgun (RAIL) is the most notable, being used and backed by Vitalik Buterin. This process again works though utilisation of zero knowledge proofs across all EVM chains (Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.) and because of this it sits on-chain and works with existing EVM networks, users don\u2019t need to move assets off chain or into side networks. Technology wise, this is the most advanced. The down side is potential regulatory changes and in terms of when funds enter or exit the shielded pool, there may still be traces or timing heuristics.\n\nI personally think there is a future for all three. However, I think Monero has largely reached its potential. Based on market cap, I see the biggest growth in Railgun and Tornado Cash.\n\nWhat do you think privacy in crypto will look like in the next 5-10 years?\n\n\\*Edit: Updated to include lift of sanctions", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 06:00:36", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o06rpc/what_will_privacy_in_crypto_look_like_in_10_years/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.19197845804988664}

From my understand Hype was taking A TON of perp volume from Binance resulting in Binance arguably not being happy.\n\nThis lead to Binance Labs and CZ backing a perp DEX called Aster\n\n[https:\\/\\/x.com\\/cz\\_binance\\/status\\/1912414352969212139](https://preview.redd.it/tzaa6qi08mtf1.png?width=405&format=png&auto=webp&s=97fc6810b8a0a8233ed7bda3c31a37bbb46a2386)\n\nThis platform launched a token a few weeks ago and since they did CZ has been non stop pumping Aster. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sg0zt8ef8mtf1.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=244b6ee1d2a54d2b423e177822f72949778bb22c\n\nIn fact you might have heard of a post yesterday from defi lama that accused BNB of working with Aster to wash trade for volume. [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nz2b34/defillama_delists_aster_from_website_after/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t03ogkcn3mtf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7229dd373db3300e87c1c9907705c819f813a2a1\n\nFrom the available evidence it seems clear **AT THE VERY LEAST** BNB/CZ doesn't like Hype as it take potential revenue and they are working to some extent with a competing leverage DEX to steal marketshare and redirect those traders back into platforms where Binance has a hand in the pot.\n\nBut that's only half the story. The other half is in Hypes price chart. Hype has been unable to hold any recovery gains since this all started while Bitcoin keeps climbing and hitting new ATHs. Hype is currently exactly where it was when Bitcoin was 112k just ten days ago. With any Bitcoin fueled Hype rally just as quickly being sold off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itq0a2xn4mtf1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=1958a78f080183ff1c929a1a6a5b18ef5e8bf161\n\nFrom what I've been thinking someone with enough money could suppress price discovery of Hype while Bitcoin goes for a brand new ATH. Then when Bitcoin 'eventually' naturally retraces Hype along with other alts will likely drop more and they could close short leverage positions in profit. It's not a sure thing but it seems like a strategic bet if we assume price and profit has to do with users and fees.\n\nSo my question is, is this movement the result of a local bubble or is it something CZ Binance and CO have something to do with?", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 04:08:06", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o04snj/is_the_hype_token_being_crimed_by_cz_binance_or/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.04759740259740259}

Traders shouldn\u2019t need ten tabs open to trade, stake, learn, or find the next opportunity, and projects shouldn\u2019t need to juggle launchpads, DEXs, and bots to grow. Pineapple brings it all together in one connected ecosystem designed for the next billion on-chain users.\n\nWe last joined you for an AMA months ago - and it\u2019s safe to say a lot has changed since then. Since then, we\u2019ve:\n\n\u2022 Launched PineappleDEX Lite, and now rolled out the full PineappleDEX with CEX-grade limit orders\n\n\u2022 Continued to develop $PAPPLE utility, with stakers able to earn up to 15% APY, access to new token launches, and exclusive events. And soon, you\u2019ll be able to spend $PAPPLE at millions of merchants and ATMs worldwide\n\n\u2022 Integrated Solana, joining BNB, Ethereum, and Base, with many more chains to come\n\n\u2022 Opened Pineapple Mansion: our members-only ecosystem where top-tier stakers gain exclusive access to AMAs, private events, and luxury perks\n\n\u2022 Announced the first project launching through Pineapple Express (our community-first incubation and launchpad platform): a Harvard-backed team building the future of decentralized healthcare. Full details coming this Friday!\n\n\u2022 Partnered with Aaron Ramsey, ex-Arsenal, Juventus, and Welsh national team footballer with a global audience exceeding 2 billion across his channels and partnerships\n\n\u2022 Became the official exchange partner of Polaris, the fastest-growing combat sports league with hundreds of millions of viewers annually, and a presence on UFC Fight Pass\n\n\u2022 Brought on almost a dozen Conor McGregor-backed BKFC fighters as ambassadors, and even hosted a private yacht event for our top stakers and whales.\n\nWe\u2019ve been called one of the most active and innovative teams in DeFi - not just in product delivery, but in partnerships, marketing, and community building.\n\nNow, we\u2019re here to share what\u2019s next - and trust me, there\u2019s a lot just around the corner. From real-world assets and AI-powered trading, to new launchpad projects and global partnerships, the next phase of Pineapple is built to redefine how DeFi feels, functions, and grows.\n\nAMA Details:\n\n\ud83d\uddd3 Questions open: Monday, October 6\n\n\ud83d\udcac Answers posted: Tuesday/Wednesday, October 7-8\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Rewards: 25,000 $PAPPLE split among the best questions\n\nAsk me anything - from new product updates, partnerships, and $PAPPLE utility to our upcoming launches and long-term DeFi vision.\nJoin us to learn about some of the most exciting developments in DeFi just around the corner. \n\n\n", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 15:55:57", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://i.redd.it/dblbcdw8kitf1.gif", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.18568404634581107}

It\u2019s not even about the money, it\u2019s about the feeling that i\u2019m giving up at the worst possible moment. I\u2019ve held some positions through every kind of market condition, from huge runs to brutal crashes, because I believed in what they stood for. They felt real, built on something solid, and that made it hard to let go even when the market clearly didn\u2019t care.  \n  \nStill, it\u2019s hard not to question myself when other trades go wrong. My best trade ever was one I entered on a random hunch and it ended up being the biggest win I\u2019ve ever had. Then came another one that turned into a disaster, just constant bleeding, new lows every week, and no sign of recovery. I told myself I don\u2019t sell cheap, but sometimes holding feels like pretending something still has life when it\u2019s clearly gone.  \n  \nLately I\u2019ve been trying to see selling differently. Maybe it\u2019s not about quitting or being weak, maybe it\u2019s just part of staying sane in a market that never really stops moving. Some trades work out, others don\u2019t, and the real challenge for me is knowing which ones still deserve my patience. I still hate selling cheap, even atm i saw aster trending on cmc i checked on bitget and saw it added to my portfolio.

A similar analysis was done on the S&P 500.  The underlying assumption was, \"what if I suck at investing and only invested at market peaks?\"  The short answer is, 'you still make money'. \n\nI am attempting to replicate this for BTC (this is what happens when I drink).\n\nAssumptions\n\n* Assume you DCA $20 per week.\n* Assume you suck at investing and due to FOMO, you only buy at 'market highs'\n* Assume you suck so much that you purchase at the highest price during that day.\n* All numbers are USD\n\n**Method**: I pulled all data for BTC on a weekly basis.  I buy at the highest price on the given day and only if that is a 'new market high'.  First buy is $20 USD on 1/1/2017.  It takes 7 weeks to hit the next high, so I invest that $140 at the new 'high price'.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cuidsmtsqktf1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=d43054595173065cc302b105cc807bc9bd7036c0\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe table below reflects if you started this $20 DCA strategy in January of each year.  If you started in 2017, your total investment from 2017 through 2025 would be 9,100.  Your BTC would be valued at $80.7K.

How can we help them stake ETH properly?", "selftext": "The current market cycle has been characterized by the arrival of institutions, most recently in the form of DAT mania.\u00a0\n\nETH is obviously the best asset for DAT companies ... I don't need to get into why, I'm sure everyone here understands that.\n\nThese DATs are accumulating at rapid speed and almost all of them are staking or have signaled their intention to stake in the future.\u00a0\n\nThese types of institutions treat security as their top priority! In a recent [institutional survey by Obol](https://x.com/Obol_Collective/status/1973055949373141262), most of the biggest names in Ethereum staking indicated that security is a bigger concern than other variables like yield!\n\nCurrently, most major staking providers are exposed to single points of failure, correlated failures, and performance issues via legacy validator infrastructure. We all saw the recent security issue with Kiln which has spiked the exit que. This is a problem now when theres hundreds of billions at stake, but what happens when ETH is a multi-trillion dollar asset, with trillions at stake?\n\n**Interested in your opinions!**\n\n1. Should we be doing more as a community to push the existing staking providers to use Distributed Validators, as they are a more secure alternative compared to legacy validators?\n2. Should we be encouraging DATs to run their own staking nodes, instead of delegating their stake to the large centralized staking providers? Solo Staking, Squad Staking and even Rocketpool are great alternatives that foster decentralizing for Ethereum, while still ensuring these entities are meeting their security mandates.", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 16:28:14", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nznvga/new_survey_says_security_is_priority_1_for/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.2540886197136197}

{"id": "1nzfipg", "title": "Why stagflation and Fed rate cuts point toward owning assets like Ethereum.", "selftext": "So the U.S. economy is getting into uncharted territory, the Kobeissi Letter summed it up pretty well on Twitter: rate cuts are happening while core inflation is still a little over 2.9%. This is something that has not been seen in 30 years. Also on top of this the labor market outlook is getting weaker, deficit spending is well over $2 trillion annually and even jobs reports are on hold because of the government shutdown. And.. the Fed is not finished yet. Two more cuts are expected this year even as the U.S. is fighting against stagflation, slow growth mixed with high inflation. In the meantime tech giants are pouring over $100 billion every quarter into AI showing just how uneven the economy has become.\n\nWhat does this mean for us regular people?? Well the message is clear: hold assets or get left behind. Cash loses value when inflation stays sticky. Traditional bonds do not keep up when rates fall faster than prices. Assets that have independence from government policy, like ETH, stand out in this environment. As we all know well ETH is no longer just a speculative bet, it is increasingly being used as a reserve and settlement layer by institutions. If stagflation is here as it would seem then the old rule applies again: hard assets are the winner.. and for many more investors ETH is one of them.\n\nSource: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974092991842132271", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 10:39:01", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nzfipg/why_stagflation_and_fed_rate_cuts_point_toward/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.02591666666666667}

That is 330x more than what you will get for commenting in other communities and it will literally takes seconds of effort. But this is not all, if you make a post, you are looking at 836 DONUT minus 250 Pay2Post which is still an insane return.\n\nFurthermore to prevent spam and stress, we added a rule to max the reward to **42500 DONUT** currently around **$169.41** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xroj43bbfgtf1.png?width=1291&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e73150cb631bd86731a98ecf32d37875a754ff0\n\nIn summary, people are out there commenting and posting for Internet Magic Points called karma while losing the chance to do both and also earn DONUT that can be converted to real money.\n\nMy advice is to hold them because selling has a penalization if you sell more than 25% (I think) and because DONUT price right now is really cheap so you can even make more.\n\nSo here is the idea, register a wallet address, start commenting, start posting and watch your DONUT bags grow. **And of course always try to share quality content and don't spam**.

Some years ago I went through the process of trying to consolidate assets, and found that the official Wallet is now not active, and hunting for a new wallet then took a back foot.\n\nI have all the required info to get access to the wallet etc, but nowadays most wallets don\u2019t accept older wallet transfers due to the old wallet\u2019s lack of secure \u2018security\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m basically looking to see if anyone else has or was in the same boat, and what you did.\n\nPlease don\u2019t spam about your dodgy looking wallet.

{"id": "1nx9wlo", "title": "New to crypto, looking for advice on my small ETH position", "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m still relatively new to the crypto world and currently only holding a small portfolio, around $1,800 in total. The biggest chunk of that is Ethereum, sitting at about $830. My average buy-in was around $4,300, which obviously isn\u2019t great. I basically bought near the top without much strategy. That being said, I\u2019m trying to learn and figure out a better plan for the future.\n\nRight now I also hold some Solana and XRP as my other two main positions. Nothing crazy, but they\u2019re the coins I felt somewhat comfortable with at this stage. I also have a tiny meme bag just for fun, but ETH is by far the largest part of my portfolio.\n\nHere\u2019s my actual question: does it make sense to sell my ETH position towards the end of this year, November or December, and then try to buy back in during a potential correction or dip next year? Or is that just trying to time the market, which everyone says is a bad idea, and I should just hold what I\u2019ve got?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my plan for 2026 is to invest much more seriously into both BTC and ETH. This current portfolio is really just a starting point. I don\u2019t mind holding for years, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to reposition better if there\u2019s a dip coming.\n\nWould love to hear what more experienced traders and investors here would do in my situation. Thanks a lot in advance for your perspectives, I really appreciate the input.\n\nTL;DR: New to crypto, small $1.8k portfolio, most in ETH bought at $4.3k avg.

But as materkel.eth explained it on Twitter, that myth needs to die. What is true in 2025 is clear: it is faster, cheaper and smarter to deploy a Layer 2 on Ethereum than to create a brand-new L1.\n\nThe math should be self-explanatory, data across the Ethereum network shows L2 transactions costing between $0.01 and $0.10 while L1 fees stay higher. Besides that maintaining an independent L1 means constant work on validators, security and upgrades. L2 teams escape most of that and only work on their product and incentives, the things that are actually bringing in users. Community sentiment evolved too, instead of rival chains discussion now centers on Ethereum's 'superchain' model, where different interconnected L2's reinforce one another while still benefiting from the security of Ethereum. That shared trust layer keeps the whole network stronger, not weaker.\n\nGoing back to the tweet posted by materkel, his view is that any sane CTO will launch an L2. With speed, cost and product attention being the highest values in this world, building yet another L1 is not innovation.. it is distraction.\n\nSource: https://x.com/materkel/status/1973710778092970096", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 12:33:27", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwxv7p/launching_a_new_l1_today_is_like_starting_a_new/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14431818181818185}

These reserves are falling again and every time this has happened before its been the calm before a massive rally.\n\nAccording to the Tweet and the chart:\n\n* **2020-2021:** ETH reserves dropped from 16M to 10M while price barely moved. At that time gas fees were sky high , the network was congested and most of the traders were asleep. Then demand suddenly pumped thanks to events like the UNI airdrop and ETH exploded from \\~$400 to nearly $4,800.\n* **2022-2023:** This time another huge outflow happened. This time from 15M to 9M ETH. This happened during the deep in the bear market, FTX was collapsing, banks were failing but supply quietly bled off exchanges. Once macro conditions improved, ETH rocketed from \\~$1,100 to \\~$4,000.\n* **2024-2025 (Now):** We are currently sitting at historic lows (\\~9.2M ETH) while price is around $4000-$4,500. This means ETH is being accumulated and pulled off exchanges, even if price is not exploding yet.\n\nThis is important because supply leaving exchanges is like draining a bathtub while the tap is still running. If buyers keep coming and sellers eventually run dry, the result is explosive and the price surges because there is simply nothing left to sell and buyers still want it.\n\nLower interest rates, expanding liquidity, institutional money flowing back in. history suggests we are on the verge of another violent rally.\n\nIt's time to explore uncharted territory with ETH price.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482)", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 06:27:59", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwrm8k/ethereum_supply_is_drying_up_fast_and_every_time/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.06831349206349209}

That kind of climb tends to stick better than a straight-line spike. If we start closing days above 4.5k and treating 4.2\u20134.3k as a buyable dip, my base case shifts from \u201crange with wicks\u201d to \u201ctrend with shallow pullbacks.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not leaning on patterns alone. The checklist I care about is spot > futures, funding and basis staying reasonable, and dips getting absorbed without cascading liquidations. If we see that, the path to retesting prior highs isn\u2019t fantasy. If, instead, we get perma-positive funding and a wide futures premium while spot flows fade, that\u2019s a caution flag.\n\nOn chain, I\u2019m watching the boring plumbing: L2 activity and fees trending up but not choking, stablecoin velocity actually used in DeFi vs just sitting, and staking flows remaining steady. None of these are moon signals by themselves, but together they separate healthy momentum from froth.\n\nWhat would invalidate the bull read for me? A weekly close back below 4.0\u20134.1k with rising open interest and heavy long skew would look like trapped chase longs. In that case, it\u2019s back to range until proven otherwise.\n\nMy plan is simple: let price prove it above 4.5k on closes, size positions so a normal pullback doesn\u2019t wreck the thesis, and avoid chasing candles on headline days. Curious whereu guys stand....are you already positioned for continuation, or waiting for that clean confirmation before pressing risk?\n\nAlso prepping for tax season early this year since last April was a mess.

Adriano argues that the tide is turning and Ethereum is moving to its 'genius phase.'\n\nThe time is on point because institutions are locking up millions of ETH in reserves, governments are experimenting with Ethereum for settlement systems and developers are still building tools that unlock new things for the chain. The same people who said Ethereum is overhyped have to deal with the reality that it is quietly becoming the foundation for a new financial layer.

But reality is different, it is important in what context it happens and usually the context matters more than the cut itself.\n\nAccording to some historical data that shows the Goldman Sachs research, when the Fed reduces rates outside of a recession, the S&P 500 (probably crypto too now) has historically delivered impressive results with gaining around 50% within two years of the first rate cut. This happens when inflation is cooling, growth remain stable and monetary policy is shifting from restrictive to supportive. Market understands these moves as a green light for risk assets (crypto).\n\nHowever the story changes dramatically when rate cuts happen during a recession. In those cases the S&P 500 tends to fall, around 20%-30% because economic weakness overshadows the impact of lower borrowing costs. In this case COVID era cuts were an exception.\n\nIn summary\n\n* If the Fed cut because the economy is collapsing, risk assets suffer.\n* If the Fed cut because inflation is easing without a growth crisis, markets usually soar.\n\nCurrently the US economy is not in a recession and inflation continues to cool, meaning that this cycle could look more like 1995 or 2019 periods that brought us strong market rallies rather than painful downturns like in 2001 and 2008.\n\nRate cuts are powerful, but only in the right economic environment.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/techconcatalina/status/1973528164799267055](https://x.com/techconcatalina/status/1973528164799267055)", "created_utc": "2025-10-02 06:19:29", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nvw580/rate_cuts_could_ignite_massive_rallies_why/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14889455782312927}

The Ocean team is running GPU benchmark jobs to evaluate performance and stability before going fully live. It\u2019s a smart move \u2014 this next step isn\u2019t just about keeping nodes online, it\u2019s about real compute power.\n\nPhase 2 will focus on GPU-based workloads like model training, fine-tuning, and AI tasks that actually use serious resources. Rewards will switch from uptime-based to performance-based, meaning your earnings depend on how much useful compute your node provides. There\u2019ll also be upgraded dashboards, monitoring tools, and more control over your node setup.\n\nI really like where this is going \u2014 it feels like Ocean is evolving from a community experiment into something close to a decentralized AI cloud.

That\u2019s great for validation, BTC\u2019s a legit asset class, with fiscal dominance and debasement fears fueling its rise. But retail knows BTC is a big player coin now. Wall Street owns Bitcoin. It\u2019s like an oil tanker: nothing can stop it, but it\u2019s just not fast enough to be interesting. People are becoming more impatient every day. Markets need to be fast, flipping from one narrative to the next. BTC isn\u2019t capable of that kind of speed. Altcoins and emerging projects are where the speculative energy will be flowing. Bitcoin clears the path, but alts are where retail gets to dream big. If BTC breaks resistance cleanly, say above $125K, we might see fireworks, but for now, it\u2019s a consolidation game.

{"id": "1o06rpc", "title": "What will Privacy in Crypto look like in 10 years?", "selftext": "With crypto, having an open ledger is both its greatest strength and its biggest flaw. The transparency that allows anyone to verify transactions and trust the blockchain without intermediaries also means that every payment, trade, or wallet movement is visible to the world for all time. While this openness builds security and accountability, it strips away a fundamental layer of personal privacy that traditional finance still protects. As crypto adoption grows, we have seen several options evolve for privacy. In the last 7 days, privacy crypto has boomed considerably. What are the main players and options out there?\n\n1. Privacy First Native Blockchain - The most well known here is Monero (XMR). This method achieves privacy by default using cryptographic primitives like ring signatures to obscure sender among a set, stealth addresses so recipients\u2019 addresses are not publicly visible, and Ring Confidential Transactions hide amounts. The real advantage here is privacy is inherent. However, because Monero is strongly private, it tends to attract suspicion from regulators as being a tool for illicit activity. There are also limitations around DeFi smart contract capabilities.\n2. Decentralised Mixers - The biggest here is Tornado Cash (TORN). This works by users deposit ing ETH or ERC-20 tokens into a pool, wait a while, and then withdraw to a different address. The zero knowledge proof shows a depositor has the right to withdraw without revealing which deposit is theirs. The benefit here is in the simplicity however, again, sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 but then lifted in March 2025 as deemed unenforcable. Also you can see pool visibility so regulators can blacklist addresses that interact with it.\n3. On-chain privacy tooling - Railgun (RAIL) is the most notable, being used and backed by Vitalik Buterin. This process again works though utilisation of zero knowledge proofs across all EVM chains (Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.) and because of this it sits on-chain and works with existing EVM networks, users don\u2019t need to move assets off chain or into side networks. Technology wise, this is the most advanced. The down side is potential regulatory changes and in terms of when funds enter or exit the shielded pool, there may still be traces or timing heuristics.\n\nI personally think there is a future for all three. However, I think Monero has largely reached its potential. Based on market cap, I see the biggest growth in Railgun and Tornado Cash.\n\nWhat do you think privacy in crypto will look like in the next 5-10 years?\n\n\\*Edit: Updated to include lift of sanctions", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 06:00:36", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o06rpc/what_will_privacy_in_crypto_look_like_in_10_years/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.19197845804988664}

From my understand Hype was taking A TON of perp volume from Binance resulting in Binance arguably not being happy.\n\nThis lead to Binance Labs and CZ backing a perp DEX called Aster\n\n[https:\\/\\/x.com\\/cz\\_binance\\/status\\/1912414352969212139](https://preview.redd.it/tzaa6qi08mtf1.png?width=405&format=png&auto=webp&s=97fc6810b8a0a8233ed7bda3c31a37bbb46a2386)\n\nThis platform launched a token a few weeks ago and since they did CZ has been non stop pumping Aster. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sg0zt8ef8mtf1.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=244b6ee1d2a54d2b423e177822f72949778bb22c\n\nIn fact you might have heard of a post yesterday from defi lama that accused BNB of working with Aster to wash trade for volume. [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nz2b34/defillama_delists_aster_from_website_after/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t03ogkcn3mtf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7229dd373db3300e87c1c9907705c819f813a2a1\n\nFrom the available evidence it seems clear **AT THE VERY LEAST** BNB/CZ doesn't like Hype as it take potential revenue and they are working to some extent with a competing leverage DEX to steal marketshare and redirect those traders back into platforms where Binance has a hand in the pot.\n\nBut that's only half the story. The other half is in Hypes price chart. Hype has been unable to hold any recovery gains since this all started while Bitcoin keeps climbing and hitting new ATHs. Hype is currently exactly where it was when Bitcoin was 112k just ten days ago. With any Bitcoin fueled Hype rally just as quickly being sold off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itq0a2xn4mtf1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=1958a78f080183ff1c929a1a6a5b18ef5e8bf161\n\nFrom what I've been thinking someone with enough money could suppress price discovery of Hype while Bitcoin goes for a brand new ATH. Then when Bitcoin 'eventually' naturally retraces Hype along with other alts will likely drop more and they could close short leverage positions in profit. It's not a sure thing but it seems like a strategic bet if we assume price and profit has to do with users and fees.\n\nSo my question is, is this movement the result of a local bubble or is it something CZ Binance and CO have something to do with?", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 04:08:06", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o04snj/is_the_hype_token_being_crimed_by_cz_binance_or/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.04759740259740259}

Traders shouldn\u2019t need ten tabs open to trade, stake, learn, or find the next opportunity, and projects shouldn\u2019t need to juggle launchpads, DEXs, and bots to grow. Pineapple brings it all together in one connected ecosystem designed for the next billion on-chain users.\n\nWe last joined you for an AMA months ago - and it\u2019s safe to say a lot has changed since then. Since then, we\u2019ve:\n\n\u2022 Launched PineappleDEX Lite, and now rolled out the full PineappleDEX with CEX-grade limit orders\n\n\u2022 Continued to develop $PAPPLE utility, with stakers able to earn up to 15% APY, access to new token launches, and exclusive events. And soon, you\u2019ll be able to spend $PAPPLE at millions of merchants and ATMs worldwide\n\n\u2022 Integrated Solana, joining BNB, Ethereum, and Base, with many more chains to come\n\n\u2022 Opened Pineapple Mansion: our members-only ecosystem where top-tier stakers gain exclusive access to AMAs, private events, and luxury perks\n\n\u2022 Announced the first project launching through Pineapple Express (our community-first incubation and launchpad platform): a Harvard-backed team building the future of decentralized healthcare. Full details coming this Friday!\n\n\u2022 Partnered with Aaron Ramsey, ex-Arsenal, Juventus, and Welsh national team footballer with a global audience exceeding 2 billion across his channels and partnerships\n\n\u2022 Became the official exchange partner of Polaris, the fastest-growing combat sports league with hundreds of millions of viewers annually, and a presence on UFC Fight Pass\n\n\u2022 Brought on almost a dozen Conor McGregor-backed BKFC fighters as ambassadors, and even hosted a private yacht event for our top stakers and whales.\n\nWe\u2019ve been called one of the most active and innovative teams in DeFi - not just in product delivery, but in partnerships, marketing, and community building.\n\nNow, we\u2019re here to share what\u2019s next - and trust me, there\u2019s a lot just around the corner. From real-world assets and AI-powered trading, to new launchpad projects and global partnerships, the next phase of Pineapple is built to redefine how DeFi feels, functions, and grows.\n\nAMA Details:\n\n\ud83d\uddd3 Questions open: Monday, October 6\n\n\ud83d\udcac Answers posted: Tuesday/Wednesday, October 7-8\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Rewards: 25,000 $PAPPLE split among the best questions\n\nAsk me anything - from new product updates, partnerships, and $PAPPLE utility to our upcoming launches and long-term DeFi vision.\nJoin us to learn about some of the most exciting developments in DeFi just around the corner. \n\n\n", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 15:55:57", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://i.redd.it/dblbcdw8kitf1.gif", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.18568404634581107}

It\u2019s not even about the money, it\u2019s about the feeling that i\u2019m giving up at the worst possible moment. I\u2019ve held some positions through every kind of market condition, from huge runs to brutal crashes, because I believed in what they stood for. They felt real, built on something solid, and that made it hard to let go even when the market clearly didn\u2019t care.  \n  \nStill, it\u2019s hard not to question myself when other trades go wrong. My best trade ever was one I entered on a random hunch and it ended up being the biggest win I\u2019ve ever had. Then came another one that turned into a disaster, just constant bleeding, new lows every week, and no sign of recovery. I told myself I don\u2019t sell cheap, but sometimes holding feels like pretending something still has life when it\u2019s clearly gone.  \n  \nLately I\u2019ve been trying to see selling differently. Maybe it\u2019s not about quitting or being weak, maybe it\u2019s just part of staying sane in a market that never really stops moving. Some trades work out, others don\u2019t, and the real challenge for me is knowing which ones still deserve my patience. I still hate selling cheap, even atm i saw aster trending on cmc i checked on bitget and saw it added to my portfolio.

A similar analysis was done on the S&P 500.  The underlying assumption was, \"what if I suck at investing and only invested at market peaks?\"  The short answer is, 'you still make money'. \n\nI am attempting to replicate this for BTC (this is what happens when I drink).\n\nAssumptions\n\n* Assume you DCA $20 per week.\n* Assume you suck at investing and due to FOMO, you only buy at 'market highs'\n* Assume you suck so much that you purchase at the highest price during that day.\n* All numbers are USD\n\n**Method**: I pulled all data for BTC on a weekly basis.  I buy at the highest price on the given day and only if that is a 'new market high'.  First buy is $20 USD on 1/1/2017.  It takes 7 weeks to hit the next high, so I invest that $140 at the new 'high price'.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cuidsmtsqktf1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=d43054595173065cc302b105cc807bc9bd7036c0\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe table below reflects if you started this $20 DCA strategy in January of each year.  If you started in 2017, your total investment from 2017 through 2025 would be 9,100.  Your BTC would be valued at $80.7K.

How can we help them stake ETH properly?", "selftext": "The current market cycle has been characterized by the arrival of institutions, most recently in the form of DAT mania.\u00a0\n\nETH is obviously the best asset for DAT companies ... I don't need to get into why, I'm sure everyone here understands that.\n\nThese DATs are accumulating at rapid speed and almost all of them are staking or have signaled their intention to stake in the future.\u00a0\n\nThese types of institutions treat security as their top priority! In a recent [institutional survey by Obol](https://x.com/Obol_Collective/status/1973055949373141262), most of the biggest names in Ethereum staking indicated that security is a bigger concern than other variables like yield!\n\nCurrently, most major staking providers are exposed to single points of failure, correlated failures, and performance issues via legacy validator infrastructure. We all saw the recent security issue with Kiln which has spiked the exit que. This is a problem now when theres hundreds of billions at stake, but what happens when ETH is a multi-trillion dollar asset, with trillions at stake?\n\n**Interested in your opinions!**\n\n1. Should we be doing more as a community to push the existing staking providers to use Distributed Validators, as they are a more secure alternative compared to legacy validators?\n2. Should we be encouraging DATs to run their own staking nodes, instead of delegating their stake to the large centralized staking providers? Solo Staking, Squad Staking and even Rocketpool are great alternatives that foster decentralizing for Ethereum, while still ensuring these entities are meeting their security mandates.", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 16:28:14", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nznvga/new_survey_says_security_is_priority_1_for/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.2540886197136197}

{"id": "1nzfipg", "title": "Why stagflation and Fed rate cuts point toward owning assets like Ethereum.", "selftext": "So the U.S. economy is getting into uncharted territory, the Kobeissi Letter summed it up pretty well on Twitter: rate cuts are happening while core inflation is still a little over 2.9%. This is something that has not been seen in 30 years. Also on top of this the labor market outlook is getting weaker, deficit spending is well over $2 trillion annually and even jobs reports are on hold because of the government shutdown. And.. the Fed is not finished yet. Two more cuts are expected this year even as the U.S. is fighting against stagflation, slow growth mixed with high inflation. In the meantime tech giants are pouring over $100 billion every quarter into AI showing just how uneven the economy has become.\n\nWhat does this mean for us regular people?? Well the message is clear: hold assets or get left behind. Cash loses value when inflation stays sticky. Traditional bonds do not keep up when rates fall faster than prices. Assets that have independence from government policy, like ETH, stand out in this environment. As we all know well ETH is no longer just a speculative bet, it is increasingly being used as a reserve and settlement layer by institutions. If stagflation is here as it would seem then the old rule applies again: hard assets are the winner.. and for many more investors ETH is one of them.\n\nSource: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974092991842132271", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 10:39:01", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nzfipg/why_stagflation_and_fed_rate_cuts_point_toward/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.02591666666666667}

That is 330x more than what you will get for commenting in other communities and it will literally takes seconds of effort. But this is not all, if you make a post, you are looking at 836 DONUT minus 250 Pay2Post which is still an insane return.\n\nFurthermore to prevent spam and stress, we added a rule to max the reward to **42500 DONUT** currently around **$169.41** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xroj43bbfgtf1.png?width=1291&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e73150cb631bd86731a98ecf32d37875a754ff0\n\nIn summary, people are out there commenting and posting for Internet Magic Points called karma while losing the chance to do both and also earn DONUT that can be converted to real money.\n\nMy advice is to hold them because selling has a penalization if you sell more than 25% (I think) and because DONUT price right now is really cheap so you can even make more.\n\nSo here is the idea, register a wallet address, start commenting, start posting and watch your DONUT bags grow. **And of course always try to share quality content and don't spam**.

Some years ago I went through the process of trying to consolidate assets, and found that the official Wallet is now not active, and hunting for a new wallet then took a back foot.\n\nI have all the required info to get access to the wallet etc, but nowadays most wallets don\u2019t accept older wallet transfers due to the old wallet\u2019s lack of secure \u2018security\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m basically looking to see if anyone else has or was in the same boat, and what you did.\n\nPlease don\u2019t spam about your dodgy looking wallet.

{"id": "1nx9wlo", "title": "New to crypto, looking for advice on my small ETH position", "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m still relatively new to the crypto world and currently only holding a small portfolio, around $1,800 in total. The biggest chunk of that is Ethereum, sitting at about $830. My average buy-in was around $4,300, which obviously isn\u2019t great. I basically bought near the top without much strategy. That being said, I\u2019m trying to learn and figure out a better plan for the future.\n\nRight now I also hold some Solana and XRP as my other two main positions. Nothing crazy, but they\u2019re the coins I felt somewhat comfortable with at this stage. I also have a tiny meme bag just for fun, but ETH is by far the largest part of my portfolio.\n\nHere\u2019s my actual question: does it make sense to sell my ETH position towards the end of this year, November or December, and then try to buy back in during a potential correction or dip next year? Or is that just trying to time the market, which everyone says is a bad idea, and I should just hold what I\u2019ve got?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my plan for 2026 is to invest much more seriously into both BTC and ETH. This current portfolio is really just a starting point. I don\u2019t mind holding for years, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to reposition better if there\u2019s a dip coming.\n\nWould love to hear what more experienced traders and investors here would do in my situation. Thanks a lot in advance for your perspectives, I really appreciate the input.\n\nTL;DR: New to crypto, small $1.8k portfolio, most in ETH bought at $4.3k avg.

But as materkel.eth explained it on Twitter, that myth needs to die. What is true in 2025 is clear: it is faster, cheaper and smarter to deploy a Layer 2 on Ethereum than to create a brand-new L1.\n\nThe math should be self-explanatory, data across the Ethereum network shows L2 transactions costing between $0.01 and $0.10 while L1 fees stay higher. Besides that maintaining an independent L1 means constant work on validators, security and upgrades. L2 teams escape most of that and only work on their product and incentives, the things that are actually bringing in users. Community sentiment evolved too, instead of rival chains discussion now centers on Ethereum's 'superchain' model, where different interconnected L2's reinforce one another while still benefiting from the security of Ethereum. That shared trust layer keeps the whole network stronger, not weaker.\n\nGoing back to the tweet posted by materkel, his view is that any sane CTO will launch an L2. With speed, cost and product attention being the highest values in this world, building yet another L1 is not innovation.. it is distraction.\n\nSource: https://x.com/materkel/status/1973710778092970096", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 12:33:27", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwxv7p/launching_a_new_l1_today_is_like_starting_a_new/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14431818181818185}

These reserves are falling again and every time this has happened before its been the calm before a massive rally.\n\nAccording to the Tweet and the chart:\n\n* **2020-2021:** ETH reserves dropped from 16M to 10M while price barely moved. At that time gas fees were sky high , the network was congested and most of the traders were asleep. Then demand suddenly pumped thanks to events like the UNI airdrop and ETH exploded from \\~$400 to nearly $4,800.\n* **2022-2023:** This time another huge outflow happened. This time from 15M to 9M ETH. This happened during the deep in the bear market, FTX was collapsing, banks were failing but supply quietly bled off exchanges. Once macro conditions improved, ETH rocketed from \\~$1,100 to \\~$4,000.\n* **2024-2025 (Now):** We are currently sitting at historic lows (\\~9.2M ETH) while price is around $4000-$4,500. This means ETH is being accumulated and pulled off exchanges, even if price is not exploding yet.\n\nThis is important because supply leaving exchanges is like draining a bathtub while the tap is still running. If buyers keep coming and sellers eventually run dry, the result is explosive and the price surges because there is simply nothing left to sell and buyers still want it.\n\nLower interest rates, expanding liquidity, institutional money flowing back in. history suggests we are on the verge of another violent rally.\n\nIt's time to explore uncharted territory with ETH price.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482)", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 06:27:59", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwrm8k/ethereum_supply_is_drying_up_fast_and_every_time/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.06831349206349209}

That kind of climb tends to stick better than a straight-line spike. If we start closing days above 4.5k and treating 4.2\u20134.3k as a buyable dip, my base case shifts from \u201crange with wicks\u201d to \u201ctrend with shallow pullbacks.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not leaning on patterns alone. The checklist I care about is spot > futures, funding and basis staying reasonable, and dips getting absorbed without cascading liquidations. If we see that, the path to retesting prior highs isn\u2019t fantasy. If, instead, we get perma-positive funding and a wide futures premium while spot flows fade, that\u2019s a caution flag.\n\nOn chain, I\u2019m watching the boring plumbing: L2 activity and fees trending up but not choking, stablecoin velocity actually used in DeFi vs just sitting, and staking flows remaining steady. None of these are moon signals by themselves, but together they separate healthy momentum from froth.\n\nWhat would invalidate the bull read for me? A weekly close back below 4.0\u20134.1k with rising open interest and heavy long skew would look like trapped chase longs. In that case, it\u2019s back to range until proven otherwise.\n\nMy plan is simple: let price prove it above 4.5k on closes, size positions so a normal pullback doesn\u2019t wreck the thesis, and avoid chasing candles on headline days. Curious whereu guys stand....are you already positioned for continuation, or waiting for that clean confirmation before pressing risk?\n\nAlso prepping for tax season early this year since last April was a mess.

Adriano argues that the tide is turning and Ethereum is moving to its 'genius phase.'\n\nThe time is on point because institutions are locking up millions of ETH in reserves, governments are experimenting with Ethereum for settlement systems and developers are still building tools that unlock new things for the chain. The same people who said Ethereum is overhyped have to deal with the reality that it is quietly becoming the foundation for a new financial layer.

But reality is different, it is important in what context it happens and usually the context matters more than the cut itself.\n\nAccording to some historical data that shows the Goldman Sachs research, when the Fed reduces rates outside of a recession, the S&P 500 (probably crypto too now) has historically delivered impressive results with gaining around 50% within two years of the first rate cut. This happens when inflation is cooling, growth remain stable and monetary policy is shifting from restrictive to supportive. Market understands these moves as a green light for risk assets (crypto).\n\nHowever the story changes dramatically when rate cuts happen during a recession. In those cases the S&P 500 tends to fall, around 20%-30% because economic weakness overshadows the impact of lower borrowing costs. In this case COVID era cuts were an exception.\n\nIn summary\n\n* If the Fed cut because the economy is collapsing, risk assets suffer.\n* If the Fed cut because inflation is easing without a growth crisis, markets usually soar.\n\nCurrently the US economy is not in a recession and inflation continues to cool, meaning that this cycle could look more like 1995 or 2019 periods that brought us strong market rallies rather than painful downturns like in 2001 and 2008.\n\nRate cuts are powerful, but only in the right economic environment.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/techconcatalina/status/1973528164799267055](https://x.com/techconcatalina/status/1973528164799267055)", "created_utc": "2025-10-02 06:19:29", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nvw580/rate_cuts_could_ignite_massive_rallies_why/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14889455782312927}

The Ocean team is running GPU benchmark jobs to evaluate performance and stability before going fully live. It\u2019s a smart move \u2014 this next step isn\u2019t just about keeping nodes online, it\u2019s about real compute power.\n\nPhase 2 will focus on GPU-based workloads like model training, fine-tuning, and AI tasks that actually use serious resources. Rewards will switch from uptime-based to performance-based, meaning your earnings depend on how much useful compute your node provides. There\u2019ll also be upgraded dashboards, monitoring tools, and more control over your node setup.\n\nI really like where this is going \u2014 it feels like Ocean is evolving from a community experiment into something close to a decentralized AI cloud.

That\u2019s great for validation, BTC\u2019s a legit asset class, with fiscal dominance and debasement fears fueling its rise. But retail knows BTC is a big player coin now. Wall Street owns Bitcoin. It\u2019s like an oil tanker: nothing can stop it, but it\u2019s just not fast enough to be interesting. People are becoming more impatient every day. Markets need to be fast, flipping from one narrative to the next. BTC isn\u2019t capable of that kind of speed. Altcoins and emerging projects are where the speculative energy will be flowing. Bitcoin clears the path, but alts are where retail gets to dream big. If BTC breaks resistance cleanly, say above $125K, we might see fireworks, but for now, it\u2019s a consolidation game.

{"id": "1o06rpc", "title": "What will Privacy in Crypto look like in 10 years?", "selftext": "With crypto, having an open ledger is both its greatest strength and its biggest flaw. The transparency that allows anyone to verify transactions and trust the blockchain without intermediaries also means that every payment, trade, or wallet movement is visible to the world for all time. While this openness builds security and accountability, it strips away a fundamental layer of personal privacy that traditional finance still protects. As crypto adoption grows, we have seen several options evolve for privacy. In the last 7 days, privacy crypto has boomed considerably. What are the main players and options out there?\n\n1. Privacy First Native Blockchain - The most well known here is Monero (XMR). This method achieves privacy by default using cryptographic primitives like ring signatures to obscure sender among a set, stealth addresses so recipients\u2019 addresses are not publicly visible, and Ring Confidential Transactions hide amounts. The real advantage here is privacy is inherent. However, because Monero is strongly private, it tends to attract suspicion from regulators as being a tool for illicit activity. There are also limitations around DeFi smart contract capabilities.\n2. Decentralised Mixers - The biggest here is Tornado Cash (TORN). This works by users deposit ing ETH or ERC-20 tokens into a pool, wait a while, and then withdraw to a different address. The zero knowledge proof shows a depositor has the right to withdraw without revealing which deposit is theirs. The benefit here is in the simplicity however, again, sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 but then lifted in March 2025 as deemed unenforcable. Also you can see pool visibility so regulators can blacklist addresses that interact with it.\n3. On-chain privacy tooling - Railgun (RAIL) is the most notable, being used and backed by Vitalik Buterin. This process again works though utilisation of zero knowledge proofs across all EVM chains (Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.) and because of this it sits on-chain and works with existing EVM networks, users don\u2019t need to move assets off chain or into side networks. Technology wise, this is the most advanced. The down side is potential regulatory changes and in terms of when funds enter or exit the shielded pool, there may still be traces or timing heuristics.\n\nI personally think there is a future for all three. However, I think Monero has largely reached its potential. Based on market cap, I see the biggest growth in Railgun and Tornado Cash.\n\nWhat do you think privacy in crypto will look like in the next 5-10 years?\n\n\\*Edit: Updated to include lift of sanctions", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 06:00:36", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o06rpc/what_will_privacy_in_crypto_look_like_in_10_years/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.19197845804988664}

From my understand Hype was taking A TON of perp volume from Binance resulting in Binance arguably not being happy.\n\nThis lead to Binance Labs and CZ backing a perp DEX called Aster\n\n[https:\\/\\/x.com\\/cz\\_binance\\/status\\/1912414352969212139](https://preview.redd.it/tzaa6qi08mtf1.png?width=405&format=png&auto=webp&s=97fc6810b8a0a8233ed7bda3c31a37bbb46a2386)\n\nThis platform launched a token a few weeks ago and since they did CZ has been non stop pumping Aster. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sg0zt8ef8mtf1.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=244b6ee1d2a54d2b423e177822f72949778bb22c\n\nIn fact you might have heard of a post yesterday from defi lama that accused BNB of working with Aster to wash trade for volume. [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nz2b34/defillama_delists_aster_from_website_after/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t03ogkcn3mtf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7229dd373db3300e87c1c9907705c819f813a2a1\n\nFrom the available evidence it seems clear **AT THE VERY LEAST** BNB/CZ doesn't like Hype as it take potential revenue and they are working to some extent with a competing leverage DEX to steal marketshare and redirect those traders back into platforms where Binance has a hand in the pot.\n\nBut that's only half the story. The other half is in Hypes price chart. Hype has been unable to hold any recovery gains since this all started while Bitcoin keeps climbing and hitting new ATHs. Hype is currently exactly where it was when Bitcoin was 112k just ten days ago. With any Bitcoin fueled Hype rally just as quickly being sold off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itq0a2xn4mtf1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=1958a78f080183ff1c929a1a6a5b18ef5e8bf161\n\nFrom what I've been thinking someone with enough money could suppress price discovery of Hype while Bitcoin goes for a brand new ATH. Then when Bitcoin 'eventually' naturally retraces Hype along with other alts will likely drop more and they could close short leverage positions in profit. It's not a sure thing but it seems like a strategic bet if we assume price and profit has to do with users and fees.\n\nSo my question is, is this movement the result of a local bubble or is it something CZ Binance and CO have something to do with?", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 04:08:06", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o04snj/is_the_hype_token_being_crimed_by_cz_binance_or/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.04759740259740259}

Traders shouldn\u2019t need ten tabs open to trade, stake, learn, or find the next opportunity, and projects shouldn\u2019t need to juggle launchpads, DEXs, and bots to grow. Pineapple brings it all together in one connected ecosystem designed for the next billion on-chain users.\n\nWe last joined you for an AMA months ago - and it\u2019s safe to say a lot has changed since then. Since then, we\u2019ve:\n\n\u2022 Launched PineappleDEX Lite, and now rolled out the full PineappleDEX with CEX-grade limit orders\n\n\u2022 Continued to develop $PAPPLE utility, with stakers able to earn up to 15% APY, access to new token launches, and exclusive events. And soon, you\u2019ll be able to spend $PAPPLE at millions of merchants and ATMs worldwide\n\n\u2022 Integrated Solana, joining BNB, Ethereum, and Base, with many more chains to come\n\n\u2022 Opened Pineapple Mansion: our members-only ecosystem where top-tier stakers gain exclusive access to AMAs, private events, and luxury perks\n\n\u2022 Announced the first project launching through Pineapple Express (our community-first incubation and launchpad platform): a Harvard-backed team building the future of decentralized healthcare. Full details coming this Friday!\n\n\u2022 Partnered with Aaron Ramsey, ex-Arsenal, Juventus, and Welsh national team footballer with a global audience exceeding 2 billion across his channels and partnerships\n\n\u2022 Became the official exchange partner of Polaris, the fastest-growing combat sports league with hundreds of millions of viewers annually, and a presence on UFC Fight Pass\n\n\u2022 Brought on almost a dozen Conor McGregor-backed BKFC fighters as ambassadors, and even hosted a private yacht event for our top stakers and whales.\n\nWe\u2019ve been called one of the most active and innovative teams in DeFi - not just in product delivery, but in partnerships, marketing, and community building.\n\nNow, we\u2019re here to share what\u2019s next - and trust me, there\u2019s a lot just around the corner. From real-world assets and AI-powered trading, to new launchpad projects and global partnerships, the next phase of Pineapple is built to redefine how DeFi feels, functions, and grows.\n\nAMA Details:\n\n\ud83d\uddd3 Questions open: Monday, October 6\n\n\ud83d\udcac Answers posted: Tuesday/Wednesday, October 7-8\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Rewards: 25,000 $PAPPLE split among the best questions\n\nAsk me anything - from new product updates, partnerships, and $PAPPLE utility to our upcoming launches and long-term DeFi vision.\nJoin us to learn about some of the most exciting developments in DeFi just around the corner. \n\n\n", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 15:55:57", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://i.redd.it/dblbcdw8kitf1.gif", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.18568404634581107}

It\u2019s not even about the money, it\u2019s about the feeling that i\u2019m giving up at the worst possible moment. I\u2019ve held some positions through every kind of market condition, from huge runs to brutal crashes, because I believed in what they stood for. They felt real, built on something solid, and that made it hard to let go even when the market clearly didn\u2019t care.  \n  \nStill, it\u2019s hard not to question myself when other trades go wrong. My best trade ever was one I entered on a random hunch and it ended up being the biggest win I\u2019ve ever had. Then came another one that turned into a disaster, just constant bleeding, new lows every week, and no sign of recovery. I told myself I don\u2019t sell cheap, but sometimes holding feels like pretending something still has life when it\u2019s clearly gone.  \n  \nLately I\u2019ve been trying to see selling differently. Maybe it\u2019s not about quitting or being weak, maybe it\u2019s just part of staying sane in a market that never really stops moving. Some trades work out, others don\u2019t, and the real challenge for me is knowing which ones still deserve my patience. I still hate selling cheap, even atm i saw aster trending on cmc i checked on bitget and saw it added to my portfolio.

A similar analysis was done on the S&P 500.  The underlying assumption was, \"what if I suck at investing and only invested at market peaks?\"  The short answer is, 'you still make money'. \n\nI am attempting to replicate this for BTC (this is what happens when I drink).\n\nAssumptions\n\n* Assume you DCA $20 per week.\n* Assume you suck at investing and due to FOMO, you only buy at 'market highs'\n* Assume you suck so much that you purchase at the highest price during that day.\n* All numbers are USD\n\n**Method**: I pulled all data for BTC on a weekly basis.  I buy at the highest price on the given day and only if that is a 'new market high'.  First buy is $20 USD on 1/1/2017.  It takes 7 weeks to hit the next high, so I invest that $140 at the new 'high price'.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cuidsmtsqktf1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=d43054595173065cc302b105cc807bc9bd7036c0\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe table below reflects if you started this $20 DCA strategy in January of each year.

I don't need to get into why, I'm sure everyone here understands that.\n\nThese DATs are accumulating at rapid speed and almost all of them are staking or have signaled their intention to stake in the future.\u00a0\n\nThese types of institutions treat security as their top priority! In a recent [institutional survey by Obol](https://x.com/Obol_Collective/status/1973055949373141262), most of the biggest names in Ethereum staking indicated that security is a bigger concern than other variables like yield!\n\nCurrently, most major staking providers are exposed to single points of failure, correlated failures, and performance issues via legacy validator infrastructure. We all saw the recent security issue with Kiln which has spiked the exit que. This is a problem now when theres hundreds of billions at stake, but what happens when ETH is a multi-trillion dollar asset, with trillions at stake?\n\n**Interested in your opinions!**\n\n1. Should we be doing more as a community to push the existing staking providers to use Distributed Validators, as they are a more secure alternative compared to legacy validators?\n2. Should we be encouraging DATs to run their own staking nodes, instead of delegating their stake to the large centralized staking providers? Solo Staking, Squad Staking and even Rocketpool are great alternatives that foster decentralizing for Ethereum, while still ensuring these entities are meeting their security mandates.", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 16:28:14", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nznvga/new_survey_says_security_is_priority_1_for/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.2540886197136197}

{"id": "1nzfipg", "title": "Why stagflation and Fed rate cuts point toward owning assets like Ethereum.", "selftext": "So the U.S. economy is getting into uncharted territory, the Kobeissi Letter summed it up pretty well on Twitter: rate cuts are happening while core inflation is still a little over 2.9%. This is something that has not been seen in 30 years. Also on top of this the labor market outlook is getting weaker, deficit spending is well over $2 trillion annually and even jobs reports are on hold because of the government shutdown. And.. the Fed is not finished yet. Two more cuts are expected this year even as the U.S. is fighting against stagflation, slow growth mixed with high inflation. In the meantime tech giants are pouring over $100 billion every quarter into AI showing just how uneven the economy has become.\n\nWhat does this mean for us regular people?? Well the message is clear: hold assets or get left behind. Cash loses value when inflation stays sticky. Traditional bonds do not keep up when rates fall faster than prices. Assets that have independence from government policy, like ETH, stand out in this environment. As we all know well ETH is no longer just a speculative bet, it is increasingly being used as a reserve and settlement layer by institutions. If stagflation is here as it would seem then the old rule applies again: hard assets are the winner.. and for many more investors ETH is one of them.\n\nSource: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974092991842132271", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 10:39:01", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nzfipg/why_stagflation_and_fed_rate_cuts_point_toward/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.02591666666666667}

That is 330x more than what you will get for commenting in other communities and it will literally takes seconds of effort. But this is not all, if you make a post, you are looking at 836 DONUT minus 250 Pay2Post which is still an insane return.\n\nFurthermore to prevent spam and stress, we added a rule to max the reward to **42500 DONUT** currently around **$169.41** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xroj43bbfgtf1.png?width=1291&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e73150cb631bd86731a98ecf32d37875a754ff0\n\nIn summary, people are out there commenting and posting for Internet Magic Points called karma while losing the chance to do both and also earn DONUT that can be converted to real money.\n\nMy advice is to hold them because selling has a penalization if you sell more than 25% (I think) and because DONUT price right now is really cheap so you can even make more.\n\nSo here is the idea, register a wallet address, start commenting, start posting and watch your DONUT bags grow. **And of course always try to share quality content and don't spam**.

Some years ago I went through the process of trying to consolidate assets, and found that the official Wallet is now not active, and hunting for a new wallet then took a back foot.\n\nI have all the required info to get access to the wallet etc, but nowadays most wallets don\u2019t accept older wallet transfers due to the old wallet\u2019s lack of secure \u2018security\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m basically looking to see if anyone else has or was in the same boat, and what you did.\n\nPlease don\u2019t spam about your dodgy looking wallet.

{"id": "1nx9wlo", "title": "New to crypto, looking for advice on my small ETH position", "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m still relatively new to the crypto world and currently only holding a small portfolio, around $1,800 in total. The biggest chunk of that is Ethereum, sitting at about $830. My average buy-in was around $4,300, which obviously isn\u2019t great. I basically bought near the top without much strategy. That being said, I\u2019m trying to learn and figure out a better plan for the future.\n\nRight now I also hold some Solana and XRP as my other two main positions. Nothing crazy, but they\u2019re the coins I felt somewhat comfortable with at this stage. I also have a tiny meme bag just for fun, but ETH is by far the largest part of my portfolio.\n\nHere\u2019s my actual question: does it make sense to sell my ETH position towards the end of this year, November or December, and then try to buy back in during a potential correction or dip next year? Or is that just trying to time the market, which everyone says is a bad idea, and I should just hold what I\u2019ve got?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my plan for 2026 is to invest much more seriously into both BTC and ETH. This current portfolio is really just a starting point. I don\u2019t mind holding for years, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to reposition better if there\u2019s a dip coming.\n\nWould love to hear what more experienced traders and investors here would do in my situation. Thanks a lot in advance for your perspectives, I really appreciate the input.\n\nTL;DR: New to crypto, small $1.8k portfolio, most in ETH bought at $4.3k avg.

But as materkel.eth explained it on Twitter, that myth needs to die. What is true in 2025 is clear: it is faster, cheaper and smarter to deploy a Layer 2 on Ethereum than to create a brand-new L1.\n\nThe math should be self-explanatory, data across the Ethereum network shows L2 transactions costing between $0.01 and $0.10 while L1 fees stay higher. Besides that maintaining an independent L1 means constant work on validators, security and upgrades. L2 teams escape most of that and only work on their product and incentives, the things that are actually bringing in users. Community sentiment evolved too, instead of rival chains discussion now centers on Ethereum's 'superchain' model, where different interconnected L2's reinforce one another while still benefiting from the security of Ethereum. That shared trust layer keeps the whole network stronger, not weaker.\n\nGoing back to the tweet posted by materkel, his view is that any sane CTO will launch an L2. With speed, cost and product attention being the highest values in this world, building yet another L1 is not innovation.. it is distraction.\n\nSource: https://x.com/materkel/status/1973710778092970096", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 12:33:27", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwxv7p/launching_a_new_l1_today_is_like_starting_a_new/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14431818181818185}

These reserves are falling again and every time this has happened before its been the calm before a massive rally.\n\nAccording to the Tweet and the chart:\n\n* **2020-2021:** ETH reserves dropped from 16M to 10M while price barely moved. At that time gas fees were sky high , the network was congested and most of the traders were asleep. Then demand suddenly pumped thanks to events like the UNI airdrop and ETH exploded from \\~$400 to nearly $4,800.\n* **2022-2023:** This time another huge outflow happened. This time from 15M to 9M ETH. This happened during the deep in the bear market, FTX was collapsing, banks were failing but supply quietly bled off exchanges. Once macro conditions improved, ETH rocketed from \\~$1,100 to \\~$4,000.\n* **2024-2025 (Now):** We are currently sitting at historic lows (\\~9.2M ETH) while price is around $4000-$4,500. This means ETH is being accumulated and pulled off exchanges, even if price is not exploding yet.\n\nThis is important because supply leaving exchanges is like draining a bathtub while the tap is still running. If buyers keep coming and sellers eventually run dry, the result is explosive and the price surges because there is simply nothing left to sell and buyers still want it.\n\nLower interest rates, expanding liquidity, institutional money flowing back in. history suggests we are on the verge of another violent rally.\n\nIt's time to explore uncharted territory with ETH price.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482)", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 06:27:59", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwrm8k/ethereum_supply_is_drying_up_fast_and_every_time/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.06831349206349209}

That kind of climb tends to stick better than a straight-line spike. If we start closing days above 4.5k and treating 4.2\u20134.3k as a buyable dip, my base case shifts from \u201crange with wicks\u201d to \u201ctrend with shallow pullbacks.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not leaning on patterns alone. The checklist I care about is spot > futures, funding and basis staying reasonable, and dips getting absorbed without cascading liquidations. If we see that, the path to retesting prior highs isn\u2019t fantasy. If, instead, we get perma-positive funding and a wide futures premium while spot flows fade, that\u2019s a caution flag.\n\nOn chain, I\u2019m watching the boring plumbing: L2 activity and fees trending up but not choking, stablecoin velocity actually used in DeFi vs just sitting, and staking flows remaining steady. None of these are moon signals by themselves, but together they separate healthy momentum from froth.\n\nWhat would invalidate the bull read for me? A weekly close back below 4.0\u20134.1k with rising open interest and heavy long skew would look like trapped chase longs. In that case, it\u2019s back to range until proven otherwise.\n\nMy plan is simple: let price prove it above 4.5k on closes, size positions so a normal pullback doesn\u2019t wreck the thesis, and avoid chasing candles on headline days. Curious whereu guys stand....are you already positioned for continuation, or waiting for that clean confirmation before pressing risk?\n\nAlso prepping for tax season early this year since last April was a mess.

The same people who said Ethereum is overhyped have to deal with the reality that it is quietly becoming the foundation for a new financial layer.

But reality is different, it is important in what context it happens and usually the context matters more than the cut itself.\n\nAccording to some historical data that shows the Goldman Sachs research, when the Fed reduces rates outside of a recession, the S&P 500 (probably crypto too now) has historically delivered impressive results with gaining around 50% within two years of the first rate cut. This happens when inflation is cooling, growth remain stable and monetary policy is shifting from restrictive to supportive. Market understands these moves as a green light for risk assets (crypto).\n\nHowever the story changes dramatically when rate cuts happen during a recession. In those cases the S&P 500 tends to fall, around 20%-30% because economic weakness overshadows the impact of lower borrowing costs. In this case COVID era cuts were an exception.\n\nIn summary\n\n* If the Fed cut because the economy is collapsing, risk assets suffer.\n* If the Fed cut because inflation is easing without a growth crisis, markets usually soar.\n\nCurrently the US economy is not in a recession and inflation continues to cool, meaning that this cycle could look more like 1995 or 2019 periods that brought us strong market rallies rather than painful downturns like in 2001 and 2008.\n\nRate cuts are powerful, but only in the right economic environment.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/techconcatalina/status/1973528164799267055](https://x.com/techconcatalina/status/1973528164799267055)", "created_utc": "2025-10-02 06:19:29", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nvw580/rate_cuts_could_ignite_massive_rallies_why/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14889455782312927}

The Ocean team is running GPU benchmark jobs to evaluate performance and stability before going fully live. It\u2019s a smart move \u2014 this next step isn\u2019t just about keeping nodes online, it\u2019s about real compute power.\n\nPhase 2 will focus on GPU-based workloads like model training, fine-tuning, and AI tasks that actually use serious resources. Rewards will switch from uptime-based to performance-based, meaning your earnings depend on how much useful compute your node provides. There\u2019ll also be upgraded dashboards, monitoring tools, and more control over your node setup.\n\nI really like where this is going \u2014 it feels like Ocean is evolving from a community experiment into something close to a decentralized AI cloud.

But if you\u2019re scrolling through X or Reddit, it doesn\u2019t feel like the previous 2017 en 2021 bull runs. No crazy FOMO, no \u201cmy Uber driver\u2019s buying BTC vibes. Retail investors especially new ones are fading Bitcoin, and I think it\u2019s because the risk-reward just isn\u2019t exciting anymore. Retail thrives on asymmetric bets, 10x, 20x, or more. At $124K, BTC feels like crypto\u2019s Apple stock: reliable, but not the rocket fuel it was a decade ago.\n\n**Retail\u2019s Psychology: x2-5 is not enough**\n\nRetail\u2019s bored with BTC\u2019s \u201cdigital gold\u201d narrative and chasing projects with smaller market caps and bigger potential. Altcoins, DeFi, AI tokens, and even meme coins are soaking up the speculative energy. Why? According to retail investors a $100M market cap coin at $1 has a better shot at 10x-ing than BTC\u2019s. Retail wants the next Bitcoin, not the current one. They\u2019re hunting for projects that can replicate BTC\u2019s early-day magic, where $1K could become a house down payment.\n\n**Bitcoin\u2019s Maturing, But Retail Wants Speed**\n\nBitcoin\u2019s not smashing it in the retail sense because crypto\u2019s growing up. Institutional players, ETFs, and even sovereign funds are driving price action now. That\u2019s great for validation, BTC\u2019s a legit asset class, with fiscal dominance and debasement fears fueling its rise. But retail knows BTC is a big player coin now. Wall Street owns Bitcoin. It\u2019s like an oil tanker: nothing can stop it, but it\u2019s just not fast enough to be interesting. People are becoming more impatient every day. Markets need to be fast, flipping from one narrative to the next. BTC isn\u2019t capable of that kind of speed. Altcoins and emerging projects are where the speculative energy will be flowing. Bitcoin clears the path, but alts are where retail gets to dream big. If BTC breaks resistance cleanly, say above $125K, we might see fireworks, but for now, it\u2019s a consolidation game.

I\u2019m so sad now.", "selftext": "Just went and dug through my old emails and what not. \n\nFound my buys and sells in 2012. \n\nFound where I purchased a virtual mining contract from PBMining and got scammed.. anyone else remember PBMining? He was popular on the forums for a bit. He paid for ads there. \n\nFound two old exchanges I traded are that are bunk, C-Cex which is gone (scam phasing websites now replace them..). \n\nI had some amount of tips on ChangeTips that I couldn\u2019t access. \n\nI sent Riot games an email about how they should put background mining in the game as an opt in for free skins in 2013!! Like look at this\u2026 this is painful to read..\n\n> I would like to suggest that you create a feature that mines in the background of games on low power, on players computers. I am NOT suggesting that you do this \"secretly\". I'm suggesting that you could make a feature that you can turn on or off, and maybe compensates players with a little bonus RP or IP, or any other ideas you may have. Now, to talk numbers. I currently have a HP laptop with a basic Radeon graphics card, and I can mine at about 43 MHS (mega-hashes/second) at full power. So I could easily play league and mine at 0-5 MHS without noticing any performance difference. Now lets say you have 2 million players online at anytime, and 1 Million opt to have the mining in the background during a game on, averaging at 1 MHS (which is basically nothing by itself), But, with 1 million players running it, that would give you 1 Terra hash/second mining power, which at current price (bitcoin/usd) and difficulty is about 13-14,000 dollars a month in your pocket, and extra IP, RP, or whatever incentive you offer to the players in return.\n\n>Why am I suggesting this? Well there are three main reasons.\n1. As a part of the bitcoin community, I would like to see more exposure and more people learning about and using bitcoin, this would be a good opportunity for many people to learn about bitcoins and start using them.\n2. I would be okay with you using this idea with no personal compensation to me, although I would hope if you did implement it, you would give me some sort of personal gain, or allow me to work with your company on this system.\n3. As an avid player myself, I would enjoy the benefits of this system from a players perspective.\n\n>I'm just an 18 year old trying to make changes in the world, advocating for what I believe is a big part of the future. I am not with any company or anything, just a waiter at a local restaurant.\n\nI tried and sort of successfully set up a bitcoin faucet at some point, still trying to see if there\u2019s any scraps from that. I remember putting like $50 into the faucet. \n\nI found me pumping some shit coin on the Bitcoin talk threads. \n\nFound my eBay purchase of a USB miner for 17 bucks. I mined maybe $10 worth and flipped the miner back on eBay for $40ish. \n\n\n\nAll that goes to say that I basically have nothing left from it. I\u2019m proud of where crypto got but because of life I wasn\u2019t able to hold. It did help me get a car and a get my feet on the ground, but I completely missed the boat and am really struggling mentally with the day to day grind of life. Very nostalgic but also depressing.

{"id": "1o0s90f", "title": "Deep Dive into non-BTC DATs", "selftext": "Everyone knows what MicroStrategy and Michael Saylor are doing with Bitcoin.  \nThe concept of a Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) has become one of the stronger narratives this cycle, with companies holding crypto directly on their balance sheets as a core strategy.\n\nWe all Bitcoin is king daddy of them all, but companies have been adding other alts to their balance sheet. As part of my mission to add more educational content to this sub, here are the companies that are accumulating other assets like ETH, SOL, or even meme tokens.\n\nAnd also, probably more importantly, the ones are doing it with real revenue and not just capital raises\n\n# ETH-Focused DATs\n\nMost Ethereum-based DATs fund their holdings through stock offerings, convertible debt, or token raises. After that, they rely on staking or restaking to generate yield and compound their positions.\n\nThis model increases balances but doesn\u2019t introduce new external capital into the asset. In other words, they\u2019re compounding what they already raised, not creating fresh demand.  \nOther holders are effectively diluted, not strengthened.\n\n* BitMine Immersion (BMNR) \u2013 Positions itself as an Ethereum treasury that earns staking yield and reinvests mining and operating revenue into more ETH accumulation.\n* ETHZilla (ETHZ) \u2013 Uses restaking and other ETH deployments, reinvesting part of those onchain yields into new ETH purchases.\n* SharpLink Gaming (SBET) \u2013 Tom Lee's company grows its ETH position through staking rewards while initial accumulation came from capital raises.\n\nIn all three cases, the \u201crevenue\u201d comes from the asset itself through staking rewards. These returns compound existing holdings but don\u2019t create new market demand for ETH.\n\n# SOL-Focused DATs\n\nIn the Solana ecosystem, Multicoin Capital is the closest analog to a DAT.  \nIts growth comes from venture capital inflows and early accumulation, with staking yield helping compound returns.\n\nLike Ethereum treasuries, it\u2019s an internal growth loop funded by investors, not business operations.  \nNo new external cash flow is entering SOL from real-world revenue.\n\n# The Other Guys\n\nSome companies have begun to hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but these are typically passive treasury strategies rather than active revenue-driven accumulation.\n\nFor example, Bit Origin has announced plans to build a Dogecoin treasury and is raising capital (equity and debt) to acquire DOGE. Other public companies hold DOGE as part of reserves, but there\u2019s no public evidence they are making ongoing purchases to increase those holdings like with see with MSTR.\n\nAs for LTC, MEI Pharma, Inc. (MEIP), a biotechnology company, purchased 929,548 LTC tokens in August 2025, using proceeds from a $100 million private placement to establish LTC as a core treasury asset.  They haven't made any subsequent purchases.\n\nDOGE and LTC treasuries show an interest in crypto assets being held by companies, but we haven't seen further accumulation like we've seen in BTC or larger alts.\n\n# Projects Buying-Back Their Token to Burn\n\nSome projects use revenue for buybacks and burns, but that\u2019s a very different dynamic.\n\nHyperliquid is the most notable and successful example, directing roughly 90 percent of its trading fees to buy back and burn its own token.\n\nThis creates onchain demand, but the purchases are internal to the protocol. There\u2019s no external business choosing to spend its revenue to accumulate the token, which to me is a bigger indication of belief in using digital assets as a treasury holding.\n\nBuyback-and-burn mechanisms help reduce supply, but they are not the same as a company with real-world income deciding to buy and hold tokens.\n\n# Businesses Using Revenue to Buy a Token\n\nAfter researching across different ecosystems, I could only find one company using revenue to buy a token. \n\nSafety Shot, initially a publicly traded beverage company, recently acquired a 10 percent revenue share in BONK.fun and an initial 25 million dollar position in BONK tokens. They added that they will reinvest roughly 90 percent of its revenue share into open-market BONK purchases, effectively tying its business success to the BONK ecosystem.\n\nThis is wild to me, as for many BONK is just a memecoin on Solana. However, BONK.fun, the BONK ecosystem\u2019s meme launchpad, already uses over 50% project revenue to buy back BONK and other top-performing tokens launched on its platform. \n\nI'd imagine Safety Shot saw BONK's revenue model and the platform pumping its token and saw an opportunity to get in early on the success. \n\nWhile we haven't seen TradFi companies do this with other buy-back-and-burn projects (Hyperliquid, deBridge, ApeX, etc), I think if Safety Shot has success it may be the blueprint.\n\n# tl;dr\n\n* BTC treasuries are the most common, but we are seeing other assets now being accumulated by TradFi\n* ETH and SOL treasuries grow primarily from staking yield on assets funded by earlier raises, compounding internally and diluting existing holders.\n* Some companies hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but they do so via capital deployment, not via business revenue.\n* Most altcoin DATs still rely on external funding or token sales to build their holdings.\n* BONK & Safety Shot is, so far, the only case I could find where a TradFi company is using its own revenue to actively buy a token on the open market.\n\nI expect over the next 1-2 years, we'll see an explosion of DATs across many different coins. Using revenue to buy tokens is a very interesting model, similar to stock buybacks.

It runs completely inside Discord.\n\nThe hook that got me was that you literally earn their in-game currency, called\u00a0`$TLR`, just by being active in chat or sitting in a voice channel. I figured that was it, just a simple little economy game.\n\nBut then I realized there's a whole second game buried in there. It's a full-on old-school RPG.

I feel like getting in early on something like this could be huge.\n\nSo I guess my question is, what do you guys think? Has anyone else seen this or played it?

In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 18:40:56", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o0nbhz/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.12858519404572033}

She\u2019s a senior living in Los Angeles and recently retired. A few months ago, a *bank employee* at **BMO** convinced her to \u201cinvest in crypto for better returns.\u201d Since the employee worked at her bank, she completely trusted her.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened step-by-step:\n\n1. The employee helped her open an account on [**Crypto.com**](http://Crypto.com) and buy cryptocurrency (Ethereum) using her BMO bank funds.\n2. Then the employee told her to download **Trust Wallet** and \u201ctransfer her crypto there to earn more.\u201d\n3. The employee personally guided her through the setup \u2014 and we now suspect she either saw or kept a copy of the **12-word recovery phrase** (the wallet\u2019s private key).\n4. My aunt was also instructed to connect to a site via the \u201cDApps / Discover\u201d tab in Trust Wallet, supposedly for \u201cstaking\u201d or \u201cearning interest.\u201d\n5. After a while, the employee told her that her \u201cinvestment had grown\u201d and that to **claim her big returns**, she needed to **deposit more money first**. My aunt did this *twice*, believing she was just adding to her balance so she could withdraw more later.\n6. Shortly after her second deposit, **the funds disappeared** from her wallet.\n7. The employee then **quit her job** at BMO, and the bank told us they \u201ccan\u2019t do anything because she\u2019s no longer employed.\u201d\n\nThe worst part is that **my aunt did all of this secretly**, without telling anyone in the family. She truly thought she was investing wisely and surprising us later with good news. By the time we found out, it was too late.\n\nWe\u2019ve gathered:\n\n* Bank transaction records\n* [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) receipts and transfer logs\n* Trust Wallet transaction details\n* Screenshots and text messages between my aunt and the former employee\n\nThis was **her entire retirement savings**, and she\u2019s completely heartbroken.\n\nWe\u2019ve contacted BMO\u2019s fraud department, but they haven\u2019t been helpful so far. We\u2019re now preparing to report it to the **LAPD Financial Crimes Division**, **FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3.gov)**, and **Crypto.com\u2019s fraud team**.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Has anyone experienced something similar \u2014 especially scams involving *bank employees and crypto wallets*?\n* Is there any realistic way to trace or recover funds once they\u2019ve been drained from Trust Wallet?\n* Should we hire a lawyer \u2014 and if so, what kind? (Financial crimes, crypto fraud, or banking misconduct?)\n* How can we hold **BMO** accountable since their employee used her position to gain my aunt\u2019s trust and access her funds?\n\nWe\u2019d appreciate any advice or guidance.

I\u2019m so sad now.", "selftext": "Just went and dug through my old emails and what not. \n\nFound my buys and sells in 2014.\n\nFound where I purchased a virtual mining contract from PBMining and got scammed.. anyone else remember PBMining? He was popular on the forums for a bit. He paid for ads there. \n\nFound two old exchanges I traded are that are bunk, C-Cex which is gone (scam phasing websites now replace them..). \n\nI had some amount of tips on ChangeTips that I couldn\u2019t access. \n\nI sent Riot games an email about how they should put background mining in the game as an opt in for free skins in 2013!! Like look at this\u2026 this is painful to read..\n\n> I would like to suggest that you create a feature that mines in the background of games on low power, on players computers. I am NOT suggesting that you do this \"secretly\". I'm suggesting that you could make a feature that you can turn on or off, and maybe compensates players with a little bonus RP or IP, or any other ideas you may have. Now, to talk numbers. I currently have a HP laptop with a basic Radeon graphics card, and I can mine at about 43 MHS (mega-hashes/second) at full power. So I could easily play league and mine at 0-5 MHS without noticing any performance difference. Now lets say you have 2 million players online at anytime, and 1 Million opt to have the mining in the background during a game on, averaging at 1 MHS (which is basically nothing by itself), But, with 1 million players running it, that would give you 1 Terra hash/second mining power, which at current price (bitcoin/usd) and difficulty is about 13-14,000 dollars a month in your pocket, and extra IP, RP, or whatever incentive you offer to the players in return.\n\n>Why am I suggesting this? Well there are three main reasons.\n1. As a part of the bitcoin community, I would like to see more exposure and more people learning about and using bitcoin, this would be a good opportunity for many people to learn about bitcoins and start using them.\n2. I would be okay with you using this idea with no personal compensation to me, although I would hope if you did implement it, you would give me some sort of personal gain, or allow me to work with your company on this system.\n3. As an avid player myself, I would enjoy the benefits of this system from a players perspective.\n\n>I'm just an 18 year old trying to make changes in the world, advocating for what I believe is a big part of the future. I am not with any company or anything, just a waiter at a local restaurant.\n\nI tried and sort of successfully set up a bitcoin faucet at some point, still trying to see if there\u2019s any scraps from that. I remember putting like $50 into the faucet. \n\nI found me pumping some shit coin on the Bitcoin talk threads. \n\nFound my eBay purchase of a USB miner for 17 bucks. I mined maybe $10 worth and flipped the miner back on eBay for $40ish. \n\n\n\nAll that goes to say that I basically have nothing left from it. I\u2019m proud of where crypto got but because of life I wasn\u2019t able to hold. It did help me get a car and a get my feet on the ground, but I completely missed the boat and am really struggling mentally with the day to day grind of life. Very nostalgic but also depressing.

{"id": "1o0z2yu", "title": "Bitcoin as the reserve currency of a multipolar future.", "selftext": "Bitcoin is the reserve currency of the multipolar world order on standby. We are currently witnessing the beginning of the end of the petrodollar era. What happens to the global monetary system when the US dollar loses its dominance and no credible successor emerges?\n\nThe world order is becoming multipolar economically, politically and technologically. This will also be reflected in monetary policy. In such a world, it is unlikely that a new national reserve currency, whether the euro, yuan, or a BRICS currency (LMAO) will simply replace the dollar\u2019s function. Much more likely is that Bitcoin will become the neutral, non-state reserve currency of a new era of a multipolar world.\n\nThe dollar is losing its position slowly but surely. US debt is over 35 trillion dollars and is growing exponentially. Monetary credibility is being undermined by aggressive quantitative easing policies. There is geopolitical use of the dollar payment system including sanctions and the weaponization of SWIFT. There are growing attempts at decoupling by BRICS, China, Russia, and ASEAN countries. The dollar will remain important for a long time but it is no longer unchallenged.\n\nWhy not simply use the yuan, euro, or a BRICS token?\n\nThe yuan has capital controls, lacks transparency and suffers from political unpredictability.\n\nThe euro suffers from fragmented fiscal policy, political disunity and lacks geopolitical projection.\n\nThe BRICS currency is ... come on, be serious lol\n\n\n\nAll of these fail at what once made the dollar strong, which is trust, liquidity and neutrality.\n\nBitcoin fulfills exactly this new role better than any national currency. Neutrality means that no government, corporation, or nation controls it. There are no sanctions, no printing presses, and no dependence on political moods. Bitcoin has a limited and credible supply of 21 million BTC, which is mathematically guaranteed. No trust is needed, only verification. Global access requires only an internet connection. States can trade bilaterally without clearing houses, SWIFT, or reserve currency dependency. Bitcoin\u2019s digital settlement infrastructure means it is natively digital. Scaling is possible via layer-2 solutions such as Lightning, sidechains, and programmable contracts. Interoperability with CBDCs and tokenization of real assets is also conceivable.\n\n\n\nA possible scenario is the establishment of a \u201cPetro-Bitcoin\u201d standard.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Russia, or Iran could sell their oil for BTC instead of the dollar. China or India could pay in BTC, bypassing dollar dependency. States could hold BTC in sovereign wealth funds or central bank vaults as protection against fiat depreciation. Multinational corporations could use BTC as a trade reserve currency.\n\nThus, a Bitcoin-based multilateral settlement system would gradually emerge that does not replace but supplements and ultimately displaces the existing system.\n\nCentral banks will hate it at first, then copy it, and finally integrate it. Bitcoin is to central banks what the internet was to governments. it is too disruptive to ignore and too powerful to ban.\n\nThe first signs are already visible.\n\nWe are at the beginning of monetary de-dollarization, and Bitcoin is the first neutral asset that is liquid, limited, global, immutable, and non-state-backed.\n\nNot despite but precisely because of its independence, Bitcoin is the natural asset for a new multipolar monetary order.\n\n\u201cBitcoin fixes this\u201d is not a meme", "created_utc": "2025-10-08 02:48:51", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o0z2yu/bitcoin_as_the_reserve_currency_of_a_multipolar/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.04842899036447423}

Some users have indicated they won\u2019t upgrade to the new release of Bitcoin\u2019s most-used client, or switched to running Bitcoin Knots: a software fork of Bitcoin Core maintained by OCEAN CTO Luke Dashjr, a vocal critic of the change.\n> \n> The debate is quite technical, about a seemingly minor issue. Bitcoin Core 30.0 will start to relay transactions across the network with bigger OP_RETURN outputs: transactions that embed arbitrary data (like text or images) in a specific way. This appears to be a minor change because Bitcoin Core (and Bitcoin Knots) nodes do already accept these transactions once they\u2019re included in a block, while they also relay transactions that store arbitrary data in other ways.\n> \n> But the update has caused a rift because it reflects deeper concerns.\n> \n> The \u201cBitcoin Knots perspective\u201d\n> \n> Bitcoin Knots proponents generally dislike that transactions can contain arbitrary data, or as they usually call it, \u201cspam\u201d. But so far, most have begrudgingly accepted this as an unfortunate side effect of the Bitcoin protocol.\n> \n> They do believe this type of usage should be discouraged, however. When Bitcoin Core developers did this in the past by imposing a limit on the size of OP_RETURN outputs that nodes relayed, it indeed appeared to make some people decide to take these kinds of use cases to other cryptocurrencies instead of Bitcoin. (Most notably, this is commonly explained as the \u201corigin story\u201d of Ethereum.)\n> \n> The updated relay policy in Bitcoin Core 30.0 in their view symbolizes the end of such resistance. It signals to \u201cspammers\u201d that they are welcome on Bitcoin.\n> \n> One concern is that this will increasingly draw in this class of users and projects. And because Bitcoin block space is limited, using it for data storage will fill blocks up quickly, in turn driving up transaction fees, perhaps to the point where many regular (\u201cmonetary\u201d) transactions are priced out because of it.\n> \n> Another concern is that, even though arbitrary data can already be embedded in different ways, OP_RETURN makes it a bit easier to parse this data compared to other methods; it takes a little less effort to turn it into (say) an image. This, Bitcoin Knots proponents worry, also increases the risk that inclusion of illicit materials like CSAM (child sexual abuse material) could result in regulatory pressure on node operators.\n> \n> If the problem is that Bitcoin Core developers are not resisting the spammers, Bitcoin Knots represents this resistance. Even if they can\u2019t prevent arbitrary data from being included in the Bitcoin blockchain, or not prevent it completely, they at least won\u2019t help open up an additional avenue for it. In effect, they\u2019d be signaling that spam is not welcome, which they hope will have a discouraging effect.\n> \n> Assuming this discouraging effect succeeds in keeping the spammers at bay, Bitcoin Knots proponents say, Bitcoin can continue to be used for what it was originally intended: monetary transactions.\n\nThis is putting things mildly and leaves out the extreme attack scenarios where this is exploited with malice. \n\n> \n> The \u201cBitcoin Core perspective\u201d\n> \n> People can store arbitrary data on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain in various ways. Indeed, in recent years many people stored images in Inscriptions, and it could even be embedded in public or private keys.\n> \n> Most Bitcoin Core developers do agree with Bitcoin Knots proponents that none of this is great, and it\u2019s not what Bitcoin is intended for. But out of all these options, using OP_RETURN is the least harmful method, because it minimizes a computer\u2019s resource consumption, thus keeping nodes as affordable and accessible as possible.\n> \n> As such, Bitcoin Core developers figure that rather than trying to resist the use of OP_RETURN, it\u2019s better to just allow it; limiting probably only makes matters worse, and possibly much worse.\n> \n> For one, just refusing to relay these transactions technically doesn\u2019t achieve much. These same transactions could still be relayed by some other nodes, like Libre Relay nodes, or they can be submitted to miners directly to be included in blocks. This in turn could have a centralizing effect, as direct submission would presumably be done to larger miners disproportionately, who then benefit from the extra fee revenue at the expense of smaller miners. (There are also some nuanced detriments for nodes themselves if such transactions do make it into a block anyways.)\n> \n> The more robust solution \u2014 and arguably the logical next step \u2014 is to render (big) OP_RETURN transactions invalid through a consensus protocol upgrade (soft fork), so they can\u2019t get mined at all. But the problem with that, as already noted, is that people might use other, more harmful methods to store data on the blockchain. (In fact, many already prefer to use Inscriptions because this is significantly cheaper for bigger chunks of data like images.)\n> \n> In theory, some of these methods could be blocked as well. But most Bitcoin Core developers foresee that this will only lead to a game of whack-a-mole, with \u201cspammers\u201d resorting to different methods each time. It would incentivize them to \u201cdisguise\u201d their data like regular transactions, which could lead to a situation where monetary transactions and arbitrary data become increasingly indistinguishable from each other.\n\nyes, that would be great, we want that.\n\n> \n> The only solution left in this stage might be to designate some person or group to make judgement calls about which transactions are acceptable and which are not, in effect introducing some kind of entity that has the power to impose censorship. \n\nthis is a retarded ass take. \n\n>Bitcoin Core developers (themselves a rather amorphous group of contributors) have no interest in taking on such a role \u2014 not least because they don\u2019t wish to become a target for regulators that could force them to abuse this power \u2014 and prefer Bitcoin not to go down this path at all.\n> \n\nalso, dumb. they're afraid of one end of a pointy stick while swallowing it's other end.\n\n> Instead, they generally expect that the problem will resolve itself over time, without their interference.\n\nwell, they are interfering by changing the op return limit default...\n\n> \n> This is because a monetary transaction is relatively speaking a tiny bit of data. A single Bitcoin block can fit thousands of them. Other types of data tend to be much larger; just one image can fill up an entire block. This means that a single \u201cspammer\u201d typically has to outbid many regular users. Given enough demand for monetary transactions, using Bitcoin for data storage quickly becomes expensive. Arbitrary data should in this scenario be priced out and disappear organically.\n> \n\nnot really the actual concern.\n\n> Most Bitcoin Core developers agree that Bitcoin should be a network primarily for monetary transactions\u2014 but not because they\u2019ll actively resist other use cases, rather because this is how the incentives of the system already align.\n> \n\nno one cares about their words, we care about their actions.\n\n> So now what?\n> \n> Everyone is free to use whatever software they want, whether this is Bitcoin Core 30.0 (with or without touching this default setting), an older version of Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Knots, Libre Relay, or anything else. In this sense Bitcoin users are, in a very real way, sovereign.\n\ndefaults are sticky. they matter.\n\n> \n> Judging by sentiments on social media platforms like X, it does seem that some non-trivial segment of users won\u2019t upgrade to Bitcoin Core 30.0, or indeed switch to Bitcoin Knots. But it\u2019s impossible to tell how big of a share of Bitcoin\u2019s user base this really represents. It could be a large majority\u2026 or it could be a small (and loud) minority.\n> \n> Either way, Bitcoin does not operate like a democracy. Because every node typically relays transactions to multiple others, if even a relatively small minority of users choose to run Bitcoin Core 30.0 (or Libre Relay or something similar), larger OP_RETURNs should in fact propagate rather freely. This probably can\u2019t be stopped completely, but assuming Bitcoin Knots proponents want to at least meaningfully stifle this, they\u2019ll need to convince some supermajority of node operators (perhaps 95% or more) to join them in their filtering efforts.\n> \n> If they fail to do that, running Bitcoin Knots can be seen as a voice of dissent\u2014 but one with little practical effect.\n\nnot impressed with the illogical regurgitations in this article.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 21:43:44", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o0s98g/some_thoughts_on_a_recent_article_by_aaron_van/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.03947055589912733}

And there was more threads but lots of them got removed by mods and I got \"kicked out\" from some subs as well, that's how much people were against this back then.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of posts lately from people asking about buying Bitcoin on credit. In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 18:16:38", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o0mmqr/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.12858519404572033}

On Twitter, GalaxyBTC described how ETH has 'successfully retested the V-bottom structure and the big triangle from 2021' calling for a continued bull run into 2026. The setup is not perfect however, we need to buckle up for big price drops. GalaxyBTC warns about big dips, crabbing and plenty of 'chop' but the structure is looking like we will see five digits ETH in the future. Other technical analysts are also seeing the same phenomenon. A confirmed V-bottom setup has a high success rate with 70-80% chances of long-term bullish reversals. The last time a setup like this happened was Bitcoin's 2018 recovery and this created years of growth as we all know.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uhvihm57motf1.jpg?width=2114&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc1e9811a137ddf617875afb10fe1609ac0cbe5d\n\nThe chart above is from GalaxyBTC's tweet and it also completes a huge triangle breakout pattern that has been in the making since 2021. Combined with rising institutional demand and steady on-chain activity this supports the idea that ETH is not done yet, only taking a break before the next leg up.\n\nPredictions are a little different. Some are $4,900, others $8,600 or higher but the overall sentiment online is that ETH is technically robust. If GalaxyBTC is right then this V-bottom could be the start of ETH's road to five figures.\n\n*Source:* [*https://x.com/galaxyBTC/status/1975060419594064147*](https://x.com/galaxyBTC/status/1975060419594064147)", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 12:19:42", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1o0d665/eths_chart_signals_a_bull_run_into_2026/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.07599523809523812}

(onchain)", "selftext": "When i, in the start of July invested my hard earned money in a recently established ETH DAT, none of my money was onchain. In fact it had never been onchain and i had no plans for that to change. My investment was to get exposure to eth through the DAT, an asset i knew next to nothing about except: crypto=UP FAST + Blockchain good wow. That was about to change..\n\nSince 20% of my port now was exposed indirectly to ETH, i forced myself to atleast try to understand. And boy was i in for a ride.. \n\nWeekly updates on eth aquired, new partnerships with onchain players, Staking, stablecoins, TVL etc. All of it, i understood: NADA COMPENDRE!\n\nBut what it did, was something special, it opened my eyes. This asset i knew next to nothing about was not just \"the next Bitcoin moonshot go sky boom wow!\" like my apeminded naive retail investor brain thesis. It was an economy. I can still picture myself sitting in my 14 year old office chair with no wheels (fallen off from abuse), and reading about 'Staking'. \"This highly volatile crypto asset pays me interest from securing its network, and all i have to do is hold it in a staking form.. wow\" i remember thinking.\n\nMy Argument is very simple, altough alot of these DATS will eventually fail/fade out/pivot from their original strategy. One thing they have already suceeded in is: getting Retail Retards (Like yours truly), to be curious. And it shows, we almost hit an ath in monthly active addresses in august according to gemini 19.45 MILLION active addresses was recorded in the month of august 2025. Closest we've come to the ATH's of 2021 with 20 million+. I myself is a living example of this argument. \n\nMy hope for the future of the ETH + DAT relationships is that they will do more than just Aquire/Stake and further their relationships to important onchain partner. Of course in the short term pumping our bags is always neat, but for the long term getting people onchain using this beautiful ecosystem and realizing the use for it. Is what will bring us prosperity in the end. \n\nTLDR: DAT's Pump our bags, but most importantly bring awareness of the uses of ETH, i myself is a DAT RETARD RETAIL investor turned onchain obeyer.\n\nSincerely Fatkid13yrsold, former Retard Retailer turned Onchain Obeyer and Believer in somETHing.\n\n", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 11:06:44", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1o0bojq/dats_what_are_they_good_for_onchain/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.06192400192400191}

This is something that has not been seen in 30 years. Also on top of this the labor market outlook is getting weaker, deficit spending is well over $2 trillion annually and even jobs reports are on hold because of the government shutdown. And.. the Fed is not finished yet. Two more cuts are expected this year even as the U.S. is fighting against stagflation, slow growth mixed with high inflation. In the meantime tech giants are pouring over $100 billion every quarter into AI showing just how uneven the economy has become.\n\nWhat does this mean for us regular people?? Well the message is clear: hold assets or get left behind. Cash loses value when inflation stays sticky. Traditional bonds do not keep up when rates fall faster than prices. Assets that have independence from government policy, like ETH, stand out in this environment. As we all know well ETH is no longer just a speculative bet, it is increasingly being used as a reserve and settlement layer by institutions.

Same with pay to post and even if you end in negative no one will make you pay them.\n\n# \ud83d\udc5b How to register a wallet address\n\nYou can just comment the following command replacing wallet address by yours and you will register\n\n`!register <wallet address>`\n\nOr you can do it in [https://donutdao.org/](https://donutdao.org/) (scroll to the bottom to see the register part)\n\n# \ud83c\udfea How to Buy DONUT\n\nEven thought the team is working hard to get DONUT listed in a CEX (DONUT had an audit to improve the chances to be listed) we still are only on DEX.

Some years ago I went through the process of trying to consolidate assets, and found that the official Wallet is now not active, and hunting for a new wallet then took a back foot.\n\nI have all the required info to get access to the wallet etc, but nowadays most wallets don\u2019t accept older wallet transfers due to the old wallet\u2019s lack of secure \u2018security\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m basically looking to see if anyone else has or was in the same boat, and what you did.\n\nPlease don\u2019t spam about your dodgy looking wallet. I of course will be doing due diligence on any info I obtain here. \n\nI\u2019m struggling to hit the word limit here so apologies for the rambling and random additional comments. I just need to hit that glorious 200 word limit in order to post. I\u2019m sorry mods if I\u2019ve been disingenuous in getting round the limit and completely understand why it is in place (I am legitimately just looking for assistance).

The biggest chunk of that is Ethereum, sitting at about $830. My average buy-in was around $4,300, which obviously isn\u2019t great. I basically bought near the top without much strategy. That being said, I\u2019m trying to learn and figure out a better plan for the future.\n\nRight now I also hold some Solana and XRP as my other two main positions. Nothing crazy, but they\u2019re the coins I felt somewhat comfortable with at this stage. I also have a tiny meme bag just for fun, but ETH is by far the largest part of my portfolio.\n\nHere\u2019s my actual question: does it make sense to sell my ETH position towards the end of this year, November or December, and then try to buy back in during a potential correction or dip next year? Or is that just trying to time the market, which everyone says is a bad idea, and I should just hold what I\u2019ve got?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my plan for 2026 is to invest much more seriously into both BTC and ETH. This current portfolio is really just a starting point. I don\u2019t mind holding for years, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to reposition better if there\u2019s a dip coming.\n\nWould love to hear what more experienced traders and investors here would do in my situation. Thanks a lot in advance for your perspectives, I really appreciate the input.\n\nTL;DR: New to crypto, small $1.8k portfolio, most in ETH bought at $4.3k avg.

But as materkel.eth explained it on Twitter, that myth needs to die. What is true in 2025 is clear: it is faster, cheaper and smarter to deploy a Layer 2 on Ethereum than to create a brand-new L1.\n\nThe math should be self-explanatory, data across the Ethereum network shows L2 transactions costing between $0.01 and $0.10 while L1 fees stay higher. Besides that maintaining an independent L1 means constant work on validators, security and upgrades. L2 teams escape most of that and only work on their product and incentives, the things that are actually bringing in users. Community sentiment evolved too, instead of rival chains discussion now centers on Ethereum's 'superchain' model, where different interconnected L2's reinforce one another while still benefiting from the security of Ethereum. That shared trust layer keeps the whole network stronger, not weaker.\n\nGoing back to the tweet posted by materkel, his view is that any sane CTO will launch an L2. With speed, cost and product attention being the highest values in this world, building yet another L1 is not innovation.. it is distraction.\n\nSource: https://x.com/materkel/status/1973710778092970096", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 12:33:27", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwxv7p/launching_a_new_l1_today_is_like_starting_a_new/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14431818181818185}

In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 19:19:40", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o0oeaj/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.12858519404572033}

He was popular on the forums for a bit. He paid for ads there. \n\nFound two old exchanges I traded are that are bunk, C-Cex which is gone (scam phasing websites now replace them..). \n\nI had some amount of tips on ChangeTips that I couldn\u2019t access. \n\nI sent Riot games an email about how they should put background mining in the game as an opt in for free skins in 2013!! Like look at this\u2026 this is painful to read..\n\n> I would like to suggest that you create a feature that mines in the background of games on low power, on players computers. I am NOT suggesting that you do this \"secretly\". I'm suggesting that you could make a feature that you can turn on or off, and maybe compensates players with a little bonus RP or IP, or any other ideas you may have. Now, to talk numbers. I currently have a HP laptop with a basic Radeon graphics card, and I can mine at about 43 MHS (mega-hashes/second) at full power. So I could easily play league and mine at 0-5 MHS without noticing any performance difference. Now lets say you have 2 million players online at anytime, and 1 Million opt to have the mining in the background during a game on, averaging at 1 MHS (which is basically nothing by itself), But, with 1 million players running it, that would give you 1 Terra hash/second mining power, which at current price (bitcoin/usd) and difficulty is about 13-14,000 dollars a month in your pocket, and extra IP, RP, or whatever incentive you offer to the players in return.\n\n>Why am I suggesting this? Well there are three main reasons.\n1. As a part of the bitcoin community, I would like to see more exposure and more people learning about and using bitcoin, this would be a good opportunity for many people to learn about bitcoins and start using them.\n2. I would be okay with you using this idea with no personal compensation to me, although I would hope if you did implement it, you would give me some sort of personal gain, or allow me to work with your company on this system.\n3. As an avid player myself, I would enjoy the benefits of this system from a players perspective.\n\n>I'm just an 18 year old trying to make changes in the world, advocating for what I believe is a big part of the future. I am not with any company or anything, just a waiter at a local restaurant.\n\nI tried and sort of successfully set up a bitcoin faucet at some point, still trying to see if there\u2019s any scraps from that. I remember putting like $50 into the faucet. \n\nI found me pumping some shit coin on the Bitcoin talk threads. \n\nFound my eBay purchase of a USB miner for 17 bucks. I mined maybe $10 worth and flipped the miner back on eBay for $40ish. \n\n\n\nAll that goes to say that I basically have nothing left from it. I\u2019m proud of where crypto got but because of life I wasn\u2019t able to hold. It did help me get a car and a get my feet on the ground, but I completely missed the boat and am really struggling mentally with the day to day grind of life. Very nostalgic but also depressing.

{"id": "1o0s90f", "title": "Deep Dive into non-BTC DATs", "selftext": "Everyone knows what MicroStrategy and Michael Saylor are doing with Bitcoin.  \nThe concept of a Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) has become one of the stronger narratives this cycle, with companies holding crypto directly on their balance sheets as a core strategy.\n\nWe all Bitcoin is king daddy of them all, but companies have been adding other alts to their balance sheet. As part of my mission to add more educational content to this sub, here are the companies that are accumulating other assets like ETH, SOL, or even meme tokens.\n\nAnd also, probably more importantly, the ones are doing it with real revenue and not just capital raises\n\n# ETH-Focused DATs\n\nMost Ethereum-based DATs fund their holdings through stock offerings, convertible debt, or token raises. After that, they rely on staking or restaking to generate yield and compound their positions.\n\nThis model increases balances but doesn\u2019t introduce new external capital into the asset. In other words, they\u2019re compounding what they already raised, not creating fresh demand.  \nOther holders are effectively diluted, not strengthened.\n\n* BitMine Immersion (BMNR) \u2013 Positions itself as an Ethereum treasury that earns staking yield and reinvests mining and operating revenue into more ETH accumulation.\n* ETHZilla (ETHZ) \u2013 Uses restaking and other ETH deployments, reinvesting part of those onchain yields into new ETH purchases.\n* SharpLink Gaming (SBET) \u2013 Tom Lee's company grows its ETH position through staking rewards while initial accumulation came from capital raises.\n\nIn all three cases, the \u201crevenue\u201d comes from the asset itself through staking rewards. These returns compound existing holdings but don\u2019t create new market demand for ETH.\n\n# SOL-Focused DATs\n\nIn the Solana ecosystem, Multicoin Capital is the closest analog to a DAT.  \nIts growth comes from venture capital inflows and early accumulation, with staking yield helping compound returns.\n\nLike Ethereum treasuries, it\u2019s an internal growth loop funded by investors, not business operations.  \nNo new external cash flow is entering SOL from real-world revenue.\n\n# The Other Guys\n\nSome companies have begun to hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but these are typically passive treasury strategies rather than active revenue-driven accumulation.\n\nFor example, Bit Origin has announced plans to build a Dogecoin treasury and is raising capital (equity and debt) to acquire DOGE. Other public companies hold DOGE as part of reserves, but there\u2019s no public evidence they are making ongoing purchases to increase those holdings like with see with MSTR.\n\nAs for LTC, MEI Pharma, Inc. (MEIP), a biotechnology company, purchased 929,548 LTC tokens in August 2025, using proceeds from a $100 million private placement to establish LTC as a core treasury asset.  They haven't made any subsequent purchases.\n\nDOGE and LTC treasuries show an interest in crypto assets being held by companies, but we haven't seen further accumulation like we've seen in BTC or larger alts.\n\n# Projects Buying-Back Their Token to Burn\n\nSome projects use revenue for buybacks and burns, but that\u2019s a very different dynamic.\n\nHyperliquid is the most notable and successful example, directing roughly 90 percent of its trading fees to buy back and burn its own token.\n\nThis creates onchain demand, but the purchases are internal to the protocol. There\u2019s no external business choosing to spend its revenue to accumulate the token, which to me is a bigger indication of belief in using digital assets as a treasury holding.\n\nBuyback-and-burn mechanisms help reduce supply, but they are not the same as a company with real-world income deciding to buy and hold tokens.\n\n# Businesses Using Revenue to Buy a Token\n\nAfter researching across different ecosystems, I could only find one company using revenue to buy a token. \n\nSafety Shot, initially a publicly traded beverage company, recently acquired a 10 percent revenue share in BONK.fun and an initial 25 million dollar position in BONK tokens. They added that they will reinvest roughly 90 percent of its revenue share into open-market BONK purchases, effectively tying its business success to the BONK ecosystem.\n\nThis is wild to me, as for many BONK is just a memecoin on Solana. However, BONK.fun, the BONK ecosystem\u2019s meme launchpad, already uses over 50% project revenue to buy back BONK and other top-performing tokens launched on its platform. \n\nI'd imagine Safety Shot saw BONK's revenue model and the platform pumping its token and saw an opportunity to get in early on the success. \n\nWhile we haven't seen TradFi companies do this with other buy-back-and-burn projects (Hyperliquid, deBridge, ApeX, etc), I think if Safety Shot has success it may be the blueprint.\n\n# tl;dr\n\n* BTC treasuries are the most common, but we are seeing other assets now being accumulated by TradFi\n* ETH and SOL treasuries grow primarily from staking yield on assets funded by earlier raises, compounding internally and diluting existing holders.\n* Some companies hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but they do so via capital deployment, not via business revenue.\n* Most altcoin DATs still rely on external funding or token sales to build their holdings.\n* BONK & Safety Shot is, so far, the only case I could find where a TradFi company is using its own revenue to actively buy a token on the open market.\n\nI expect over the next 1-2 years, we'll see an explosion of DATs across many different coins. Using revenue to buy tokens is a very interesting model, similar to stock buybacks.

It runs completely inside Discord.\n\nThe hook that got me was that you literally earn their in-game currency, called\u00a0`$TLR`, just by being active in chat or sitting in a voice channel. I figured that was it, just a simple little economy game.\n\nBut then I realized there's a whole second game buried in there. It's a full-on old-school RPG. You pick a class (I went with Rogue, obviously), you can join guilds, fight mobs that have actual mechanics, craft gear, and they even have these server-wide World Boss events on the weekends. It feels like two completely different games\u2014an economic sim and a combat RPG\u2014running at the same time.\n\nThe admins are talking about how it's all going to eventually be a full Web3 project with NFTs and a real token, which sounds pretty ambitious. I feel like getting in early on something like this could be huge.\n\nSo I guess my question is, what do you guys think? Has anyone else seen this or played it? I can't decide if it's a hidden gem or just a huge time-sink with big promises.

I agreed and started to look into the issues but the more i saw about the project itself and overheard a phonecall with the woman who recruited him, i became more and more suspicious and i actually asked him about it and we began to talk about it and at quite an early point i had to admit that i was 99% sure that all of this was a scam and from there on we looked deeper and i also talked to that woman and after all of that i'm only even more convinced it's a scam. \n\nThe \"project\" is called \"Five Pillars Token\" and there are so many redflags imho... the numbers on CoinMarketCap do not add up, the whitepaper imho is not a whitepaper but just reads more like another marketing catalog.

What's interesting though is that the Board leader of the company \"Auvesta\" which is used for the rare metal investmens is being present at real life events of the team of this coin.

In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 18:40:56", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o0nbhz/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.12858519404572033}

She\u2019s a senior living in Los Angeles and recently retired. A few months ago, a *bank employee* at **BMO** convinced her to \u201cinvest in crypto for better returns.\u201d Since the employee worked at her bank, she completely trusted her.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened step-by-step:\n\n1. The employee helped her open an account on [**Crypto.com**](http://Crypto.com) and buy cryptocurrency (Ethereum) using her BMO bank funds.\n2. Then the employee told her to download **Trust Wallet** and \u201ctransfer her crypto there to earn more.\u201d\n3. The employee personally guided her through the setup \u2014 and we now suspect she either saw or kept a copy of the **12-word recovery phrase** (the wallet\u2019s private key).\n4. My aunt was also instructed to connect to a site via the \u201cDApps / Discover\u201d tab in Trust Wallet, supposedly for \u201cstaking\u201d or \u201cearning interest.\u201d\n5. After a while, the employee told her that her \u201cinvestment had grown\u201d and that to **claim her big returns**, she needed to **deposit more money first**. My aunt did this *twice*, believing she was just adding to her balance so she could withdraw more later.\n6. Shortly after her second deposit, **the funds disappeared** from her wallet.\n7. The employee then **quit her job** at BMO, and the bank told us they \u201ccan\u2019t do anything because she\u2019s no longer employed.\u201d\n\nThe worst part is that **my aunt did all of this secretly**, without telling anyone in the family. She truly thought she was investing wisely and surprising us later with good news. By the time we found out, it was too late.\n\nWe\u2019ve gathered:\n\n* Bank transaction records\n* [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) receipts and transfer logs\n* Trust Wallet transaction details\n* Screenshots and text messages between my aunt and the former employee\n\nThis was **her entire retirement savings**, and she\u2019s completely heartbroken.\n\nWe\u2019ve contacted BMO\u2019s fraud department, but they haven\u2019t been helpful so far. We\u2019re now preparing to report it to the **LAPD Financial Crimes Division**, **FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3.gov)**, and **Crypto.com\u2019s fraud team**.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Has anyone experienced something similar \u2014 especially scams involving *bank employees and crypto wallets*?\n* Is there any realistic way to trace or recover funds once they\u2019ve been drained from Trust Wallet?\n* Should we hire a lawyer \u2014 and if so, what kind? (Financial crimes, crypto fraud, or banking misconduct?)\n* How can we hold **BMO** accountable since their employee used her position to gain my aunt\u2019s trust and access her funds?\n\nWe\u2019d appreciate any advice or guidance. This has destroyed my aunt emotionally \u2014 this was her life savings, and she\u2019s been crying every day since it happened.\n\nThank you to anyone who can share insights or next steps.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 11:53:43", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o0cmfp/my_aunt_in_los_angeles_was_scammed_by_a_former/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.09065040650406504}

He was popular on the forums for a bit. He paid for ads there. \n\nFound two old exchanges I traded are that are bunk, C-Cex which is gone (scam phasing websites now replace them..). \n\nI had some amount of tips on ChangeTips that I couldn\u2019t access. \n\nI sent Riot games an email about how they should put background mining in the game as an opt in for free skins in 2013!! Like look at this\u2026 this is painful to read..\n\n> I would like to suggest that you create a feature that mines in the background of games on low power, on players computers. I am NOT suggesting that you do this \"secretly\". I'm suggesting that you could make a feature that you can turn on or off, and maybe compensates players with a little bonus RP or IP, or any other ideas you may have. Now, to talk numbers. I currently have a HP laptop with a basic Radeon graphics card, and I can mine at about 43 MHS (mega-hashes/second) at full power. So I could easily play league and mine at 0-5 MHS without noticing any performance difference. Now lets say you have 2 million players online at anytime, and 1 Million opt to have the mining in the background during a game on, averaging at 1 MHS (which is basically nothing by itself), But, with 1 million players running it, that would give you 1 Terra hash/second mining power, which at current price (bitcoin/usd) and difficulty is about 13-14,000 dollars a month in your pocket, and extra IP, RP, or whatever incentive you offer to the players in return.\n\n>Why am I suggesting this? Well there are three main reasons.\n1. As a part of the bitcoin community, I would like to see more exposure and more people learning about and using bitcoin, this would be a good opportunity for many people to learn about bitcoins and start using them.\n2. I would be okay with you using this idea with no personal compensation to me, although I would hope if you did implement it, you would give me some sort of personal gain, or allow me to work with your company on this system.\n3. As an avid player myself, I would enjoy the benefits of this system from a players perspective.\n\n>I'm just an 18 year old trying to make changes in the world, advocating for what I believe is a big part of the future. I am not with any company or anything, just a waiter at a local restaurant.\n\nI tried and sort of successfully set up a bitcoin faucet at some point, still trying to see if there\u2019s any scraps from that. I remember putting like $50 into the faucet. \n\nI found me pumping some shit coin on the Bitcoin talk threads. \n\nFound my eBay purchase of a USB miner for 17 bucks. I mined maybe $10 worth and flipped the miner back on eBay for $40ish. \n\n\n\nAll that goes to say that I basically have nothing left from it. I\u2019m proud of where crypto got but because of life I wasn\u2019t able to hold. It did help me get a car and a get my feet on the ground, but I completely missed the boat and am really struggling mentally with the day to day grind of life. Very nostalgic but also depressing.

We are currently witnessing the beginning of the end of the petrodollar era. What happens to the global monetary system when the US dollar loses its dominance and no credible successor emerges?\n\nThe world order is becoming multipolar economically, politically and technologically. This will also be reflected in monetary policy. In such a world, it is unlikely that a new national reserve currency, whether the euro, yuan, or a BRICS currency (LMAO) will simply replace the dollar\u2019s function. Much more likely is that Bitcoin will become the neutral, non-state reserve currency of a new era of a multipolar world.\n\nThe dollar is losing its position slowly but surely. US debt is over 35 trillion dollars and is growing exponentially. Monetary credibility is being undermined by aggressive quantitative easing policies. There is geopolitical use of the dollar payment system including sanctions and the weaponization of SWIFT. There are growing attempts at decoupling by BRICS, China, Russia, and ASEAN countries. The dollar will remain important for a long time but it is no longer unchallenged.\n\nWhy not simply use the yuan, euro, or a BRICS token?\n\nThe yuan has capital controls, lacks transparency and suffers from political unpredictability.\n\nThe euro suffers from fragmented fiscal policy, political disunity and lacks geopolitical projection.\n\nThe BRICS currency is ... come on, be serious lol\n\n\n\nAll of these fail at what once made the dollar strong, which is trust, liquidity and neutrality.\n\nBitcoin fulfills exactly this new role better than any national currency. Neutrality means that no government, corporation, or nation controls it. There are no sanctions, no printing presses, and no dependence on political moods. Bitcoin has a limited and credible supply of 21 million BTC, which is mathematically guaranteed. No trust is needed, only verification. Global access requires only an internet connection. States can trade bilaterally without clearing houses, SWIFT, or reserve currency dependency. Bitcoin\u2019s digital settlement infrastructure means it is natively digital. Scaling is possible via layer-2 solutions such as Lightning, sidechains, and programmable contracts. Interoperability with CBDCs and tokenization of real assets is also conceivable.\n\n\n\nA possible scenario is the establishment of a \u201cPetro-Bitcoin\u201d standard.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Russia, or Iran could sell their oil for BTC instead of the dollar. China or India could pay in BTC, bypassing dollar dependency. States could hold BTC in sovereign wealth funds or central bank vaults as protection against fiat depreciation. Multinational corporations could use BTC as a trade reserve currency.\n\nThus, a Bitcoin-based multilateral settlement system would gradually emerge that does not replace but supplements and ultimately displaces the existing system.\n\nCentral banks will hate it at first, then copy it, and finally integrate it. Bitcoin is to central banks what the internet was to governments. it is too disruptive to ignore and too powerful to ban.\n\nThe first signs are already visible.\n\nWe are at the beginning of monetary de-dollarization, and Bitcoin is the first neutral asset that is liquid, limited, global, immutable, and non-state-backed.\n\nNot despite but precisely because of its independence, Bitcoin is the natural asset for a new multipolar monetary order.\n\n\u201cBitcoin fixes this\u201d is not a meme", "created_utc": "2025-10-08 02:48:51", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o0z2yu/bitcoin_as_the_reserve_currency_of_a_multipolar/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.04842899036447423}

Some users have indicated they won\u2019t upgrade to the new release of Bitcoin\u2019s most-used client, or switched to running Bitcoin Knots: a software fork of Bitcoin Core maintained by OCEAN CTO Luke Dashjr, a vocal critic of the change.\n> \n> The debate is quite technical, about a seemingly minor issue. Bitcoin Core 30.0 will start to relay transactions across the network with bigger OP_RETURN outputs: transactions that embed arbitrary data (like text or images) in a specific way. This appears to be a minor change because Bitcoin Core (and Bitcoin Knots) nodes do already accept these transactions once they\u2019re included in a block, while they also relay transactions that store arbitrary data in other ways.\n> \n> But the update has caused a rift because it reflects deeper concerns.\n> \n> The \u201cBitcoin Knots perspective\u201d\n> \n> Bitcoin Knots proponents generally dislike that transactions can contain arbitrary data, or as they usually call it, \u201cspam\u201d. But so far, most have begrudgingly accepted this as an unfortunate side effect of the Bitcoin protocol.\n> \n> They do believe this type of usage should be discouraged, however. When Bitcoin Core developers did this in the past by imposing a limit on the size of OP_RETURN outputs that nodes relayed, it indeed appeared to make some people decide to take these kinds of use cases to other cryptocurrencies instead of Bitcoin. (Most notably, this is commonly explained as the \u201corigin story\u201d of Ethereum.)\n> \n> The updated relay policy in Bitcoin Core 30.0 in their view symbolizes the end of such resistance. It signals to \u201cspammers\u201d that they are welcome on Bitcoin.\n> \n> One concern is that this will increasingly draw in this class of users and projects. And because Bitcoin block space is limited, using it for data storage will fill blocks up quickly, in turn driving up transaction fees, perhaps to the point where many regular (\u201cmonetary\u201d) transactions are priced out because of it.\n> \n> Another concern is that, even though arbitrary data can already be embedded in different ways, OP_RETURN makes it a bit easier to parse this data compared to other methods; it takes a little less effort to turn it into (say) an image. This, Bitcoin Knots proponents worry, also increases the risk that inclusion of illicit materials like CSAM (child sexual abuse material) could result in regulatory pressure on node operators.\n> \n> If the problem is that Bitcoin Core developers are not resisting the spammers, Bitcoin Knots represents this resistance. Even if they can\u2019t prevent arbitrary data from being included in the Bitcoin blockchain, or not prevent it completely, they at least won\u2019t help open up an additional avenue for it. In effect, they\u2019d be signaling that spam is not welcome, which they hope will have a discouraging effect.\n> \n> Assuming this discouraging effect succeeds in keeping the spammers at bay, Bitcoin Knots proponents say, Bitcoin can continue to be used for what it was originally intended: monetary transactions.\n\nThis is putting things mildly and leaves out the extreme attack scenarios where this is exploited with malice. \n\n> \n> The \u201cBitcoin Core perspective\u201d\n> \n> People can store arbitrary data on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain in various ways. Indeed, in recent years many people stored images in Inscriptions, and it could even be embedded in public or private keys.\n> \n> Most Bitcoin Core developers do agree with Bitcoin Knots proponents that none of this is great, and it\u2019s not what Bitcoin is intended for. But out of all these options, using OP_RETURN is the least harmful method, because it minimizes a computer\u2019s resource consumption, thus keeping nodes as affordable and accessible as possible.\n> \n> As such, Bitcoin Core developers figure that rather than trying to resist the use of OP_RETURN, it\u2019s better to just allow it; limiting probably only makes matters worse, and possibly much worse.\n> \n> For one, just refusing to relay these transactions technically doesn\u2019t achieve much. These same transactions could still be relayed by some other nodes, like Libre Relay nodes, or they can be submitted to miners directly to be included in blocks. This in turn could have a centralizing effect, as direct submission would presumably be done to larger miners disproportionately, who then benefit from the extra fee revenue at the expense of smaller miners. (There are also some nuanced detriments for nodes themselves if such transactions do make it into a block anyways.)\n> \n> The more robust solution \u2014 and arguably the logical next step \u2014 is to render (big) OP_RETURN transactions invalid through a consensus protocol upgrade (soft fork), so they can\u2019t get mined at all. But the problem with that, as already noted, is that people might use other, more harmful methods to store data on the blockchain. (In fact, many already prefer to use Inscriptions because this is significantly cheaper for bigger chunks of data like images.)\n> \n> In theory, some of these methods could be blocked as well. But most Bitcoin Core developers foresee that this will only lead to a game of whack-a-mole, with \u201cspammers\u201d resorting to different methods each time. It would incentivize them to \u201cdisguise\u201d their data like regular transactions, which could lead to a situation where monetary transactions and arbitrary data become increasingly indistinguishable from each other.\n\nyes, that would be great, we want that.\n\n> \n> The only solution left in this stage might be to designate some person or group to make judgement calls about which transactions are acceptable and which are not, in effect introducing some kind of entity that has the power to impose censorship. \n\nthis is a retarded ass take. \n\n>Bitcoin Core developers (themselves a rather amorphous group of contributors) have no interest in taking on such a role \u2014 not least because they don\u2019t wish to become a target for regulators that could force them to abuse this power \u2014 and prefer Bitcoin not to go down this path at all.\n> \n\nalso, dumb. they're afraid of one end of a pointy stick while swallowing it's other end.\n\n> Instead, they generally expect that the problem will resolve itself over time, without their interference.\n\nwell, they are interfering by changing the op return limit default...\n\n> \n> This is because a monetary transaction is relatively speaking a tiny bit of data. A single Bitcoin block can fit thousands of them. Other types of data tend to be much larger; just one image can fill up an entire block. This means that a single \u201cspammer\u201d typically has to outbid many regular users. Given enough demand for monetary transactions, using Bitcoin for data storage quickly becomes expensive. Arbitrary data should in this scenario be priced out and disappear organically.\n> \n\nnot really the actual concern.\n\n> Most Bitcoin Core developers agree that Bitcoin should be a network primarily for monetary transactions\u2014 but not because they\u2019ll actively resist other use cases, rather because this is how the incentives of the system already align.\n> \n\nno one cares about their words, we care about their actions.\n\n> So now what?\n> \n> Everyone is free to use whatever software they want, whether this is Bitcoin Core 30.0 (with or without touching this default setting), an older version of Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Knots, Libre Relay, or anything else. In this sense Bitcoin users are, in a very real way, sovereign.\n\ndefaults are sticky. they matter.\n\n> \n> Judging by sentiments on social media platforms like X, it does seem that some non-trivial segment of users won\u2019t upgrade to Bitcoin Core 30.0, or indeed switch to Bitcoin Knots. But it\u2019s impossible to tell how big of a share of Bitcoin\u2019s user base this really represents. It could be a large majority\u2026 or it could be a small (and loud) minority.\n> \n> Either way, Bitcoin does not operate like a democracy. Because every node typically relays transactions to multiple others, if even a relatively small minority of users choose to run Bitcoin Core 30.0 (or Libre Relay or something similar), larger OP_RETURNs should in fact propagate rather freely. This probably can\u2019t be stopped completely, but assuming Bitcoin Knots proponents want to at least meaningfully stifle this, they\u2019ll need to convince some supermajority of node operators (perhaps 95% or more) to join them in their filtering efforts.\n> \n> If they fail to do that, running Bitcoin Knots can be seen as a voice of dissent\u2014 but one with little practical effect.\n\nnot impressed with the illogical regurgitations in this article.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 21:43:44", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o0s98g/some_thoughts_on_a_recent_article_by_aaron_van/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.03947055589912733}

And there was more threads but lots of them got removed by mods and I got \"kicked out\" from some subs as well, that's how much people were against this back then.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of posts lately from people asking about buying Bitcoin on credit. In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 18:16:38", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o0mmqr/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.12858519404572033}

This asset i knew next to nothing about was not just \"the next Bitcoin moonshot go sky boom wow!\" like my apeminded naive retail investor brain thesis. It was an economy. I can still picture myself sitting in my 14 year old office chair with no wheels (fallen off from abuse), and reading about 'Staking'. \"This highly volatile crypto asset pays me interest from securing its network, and all i have to do is hold it in a staking form.. wow\" i remember thinking.\n\nMy Argument is very simple, altough alot of these DATS will eventually fail/fade out/pivot from their original strategy. One thing they have already suceeded in is: getting Retail Retards (Like yours truly), to be curious. And it shows, we almost hit an ath in monthly active addresses in august according to gemini 19.45 MILLION active addresses was recorded in the month of august 2025. Closest we've come to the ATH's of 2021 with 20 million+. I myself is a living example of this argument. \n\nMy hope for the future of the ETH + DAT relationships is that they will do more than just Aquire/Stake and further their relationships to important onchain partner. Of course in the short term pumping our bags is always neat, but for the long term getting people onchain using this beautiful ecosystem and realizing the use for it. Is what will bring us prosperity in the end. \n\nTLDR: DAT's Pump our bags, but most importantly bring awareness of the uses of ETH, i myself is a DAT RETARD RETAIL investor turned onchain obeyer.\n\nSincerely Fatkid13yrsold, former Retard Retailer turned Onchain Obeyer and Believer in somETHing.\n\n", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 11:06:44", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1o0bojq/dats_what_are_they_good_for_onchain/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.06192400192400191}

This is something that has not been seen in 30 years. Also on top of this the labor market outlook is getting weaker, deficit spending is well over $2 trillion annually and even jobs reports are on hold because of the government shutdown. And.. the Fed is not finished yet. Two more cuts are expected this year even as the U.S. is fighting against stagflation, slow growth mixed with high inflation. In the meantime tech giants are pouring over $100 billion every quarter into AI showing just how uneven the economy has become.\n\nWhat does this mean for us regular people?? Well the message is clear: hold assets or get left behind. Cash loses value when inflation stays sticky. Traditional bonds do not keep up when rates fall faster than prices. Assets that have independence from government policy, like ETH, stand out in this environment. As we all know well ETH is no longer just a speculative bet, it is increasingly being used as a reserve and settlement layer by institutions. If stagflation is here as it would seem then the old rule applies again: hard assets are the winner.. and for many more investors ETH is one of them.\n\nSource: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974092991842132271", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 10:39:01", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nzfipg/why_stagflation_and_fed_rate_cuts_point_toward/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.02591666666666667}

I appreciate that this is one of those danger danger type posts, but I\u2019ll go for it anyway.\n\nBack in the glory days of mining Ethereum I set up an official Ethereum Wallet. I sat on the mining proceeds for years and haven\u2019t touched them for over 8 years. Some years ago I went through the process of trying to consolidate assets, and found that the official Wallet is now not active, and hunting for a new wallet then took a back foot.\n\nI have all the required info to get access to the wallet etc, but nowadays most wallets don\u2019t accept older wallet transfers due to the old wallet\u2019s lack of secure \u2018security\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m basically looking to see if anyone else has or was in the same boat, and what you did.\n\nPlease don\u2019t spam about your dodgy looking wallet. I of course will be doing due diligence on any info I obtain here. \n\nI\u2019m struggling to hit the word limit here so apologies for the rambling and random additional comments. I just need to hit that glorious 200 word limit in order to post. I\u2019m sorry mods if I\u2019ve been disingenuous in getting round the limit and completely understand why it is in place (I am legitimately just looking for assistance).

{"id": "1nx9wlo", "title": "New to crypto, looking for advice on my small ETH position", "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m still relatively new to the crypto world and currently only holding a small portfolio, around $1,800 in total. The biggest chunk of that is Ethereum, sitting at about $830. My average buy-in was around $4,300, which obviously isn\u2019t great. I basically bought near the top without much strategy. That being said, I\u2019m trying to learn and figure out a better plan for the future.\n\nRight now I also hold some Solana and XRP as my other two main positions. Nothing crazy, but they\u2019re the coins I felt somewhat comfortable with at this stage. I also have a tiny meme bag just for fun, but ETH is by far the largest part of my portfolio.\n\nHere\u2019s my actual question: does it make sense to sell my ETH position towards the end of this year, November or December, and then try to buy back in during a potential correction or dip next year? Or is that just trying to time the market, which everyone says is a bad idea, and I should just hold what I\u2019ve got?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my plan for 2026 is to invest much more seriously into both BTC and ETH. This current portfolio is really just a starting point. I don\u2019t mind holding for years, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to reposition better if there\u2019s a dip coming.\n\nWould love to hear what more experienced traders and investors here would do in my situation. Thanks a lot in advance for your perspectives, I really appreciate the input.\n\nTL;DR: New to crypto, small $1.8k portfolio, most in ETH bought at $4.3k avg. Should I sell end of year and rebuy, or just hold and wait for 2026?", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 20:15:06", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nx9wlo/new_to_crypto_looking_for_advice_on_my_small_eth/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.1191223459080602}

{"id": "1nwxv7p", "title": "Launching a new L1 today is like starting a new MySpace.", "selftext": "For years blockchain projects chased the idea of the 'L1 premium,' that it would get you more credibility and value in the long-term if you introduced a new Layer 1 chain. But as materkel.eth explained it on Twitter, that myth needs to die. What is true in 2025 is clear: it is faster, cheaper and smarter to deploy a Layer 2 on Ethereum than to create a brand-new L1.\n\nThe math should be self-explanatory, data across the Ethereum network shows L2 transactions costing between $0.01 and $0.10 while L1 fees stay higher. Besides that maintaining an independent L1 means constant work on validators, security and upgrades. L2 teams escape most of that and only work on their product and incentives, the things that are actually bringing in users. Community sentiment evolved too, instead of rival chains discussion now centers on Ethereum's 'superchain' model, where different interconnected L2's reinforce one another while still benefiting from the security of Ethereum. That shared trust layer keeps the whole network stronger, not weaker.\n\nGoing back to the tweet posted by materkel, his view is that any sane CTO will launch an L2. With speed, cost and product attention being the highest values in this world, building yet another L1 is not innovation.. it is distraction.\n\nSource: https://x.com/materkel/status/1973710778092970096", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 12:33:27", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwxv7p/launching_a_new_l1_today_is_like_starting_a_new/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14431818181818185}

In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 19:19:40", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o0oeaj/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.12858519404572033}

He was popular on the forums for a bit. He paid for ads there. \n\nFound two old exchanges I traded are that are bunk, C-Cex which is gone (scam phasing websites now replace them..). \n\nI had some amount of tips on ChangeTips that I couldn\u2019t access. \n\nI sent Riot games an email about how they should put background mining in the game as an opt in for free skins in 2013!! Like look at this\u2026 this is painful to read..\n\n> I would like to suggest that you create a feature that mines in the background of games on low power, on players computers. I am NOT suggesting that you do this \"secretly\". I'm suggesting that you could make a feature that you can turn on or off, and maybe compensates players with a little bonus RP or IP, or any other ideas you may have. Now, to talk numbers. I currently have a HP laptop with a basic Radeon graphics card, and I can mine at about 43 MHS (mega-hashes/second) at full power. So I could easily play league and mine at 0-5 MHS without noticing any performance difference. Now lets say you have 2 million players online at anytime, and 1 Million opt to have the mining in the background during a game on, averaging at 1 MHS (which is basically nothing by itself), But, with 1 million players running it, that would give you 1 Terra hash/second mining power, which at current price (bitcoin/usd) and difficulty is about 13-14,000 dollars a month in your pocket, and extra IP, RP, or whatever incentive you offer to the players in return.\n\n>Why am I suggesting this? Well there are three main reasons.\n1. As a part of the bitcoin community, I would like to see more exposure and more people learning about and using bitcoin, this would be a good opportunity for many people to learn about bitcoins and start using them.\n2. I would be okay with you using this idea with no personal compensation to me, although I would hope if you did implement it, you would give me some sort of personal gain, or allow me to work with your company on this system.\n3. As an avid player myself, I would enjoy the benefits of this system from a players perspective.\n\n>I'm just an 18 year old trying to make changes in the world, advocating for what I believe is a big part of the future. I am not with any company or anything, just a waiter at a local restaurant.\n\nI tried and sort of successfully set up a bitcoin faucet at some point, still trying to see if there\u2019s any scraps from that. I remember putting like $50 into the faucet. \n\nI found me pumping some shit coin on the Bitcoin talk threads. \n\nFound my eBay purchase of a USB miner for 17 bucks. I mined maybe $10 worth and flipped the miner back on eBay for $40ish. \n\n\n\nAll that goes to say that I basically have nothing left from it. I\u2019m proud of where crypto got but because of life I wasn\u2019t able to hold. It did help me get a car and a get my feet on the ground, but I completely missed the boat and am really struggling mentally with the day to day grind of life. Very nostalgic but also depressing.

{"id": "1o0s90f", "title": "Deep Dive into non-BTC DATs", "selftext": "Everyone knows what MicroStrategy and Michael Saylor are doing with Bitcoin.  \nThe concept of a Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) has become one of the stronger narratives this cycle, with companies holding crypto directly on their balance sheets as a core strategy.\n\nWe all Bitcoin is king daddy of them all, but companies have been adding other alts to their balance sheet. As part of my mission to add more educational content to this sub, here are the companies that are accumulating other assets like ETH, SOL, or even meme tokens.\n\nAnd also, probably more importantly, the ones are doing it with real revenue and not just capital raises\n\n# ETH-Focused DATs\n\nMost Ethereum-based DATs fund their holdings through stock offerings, convertible debt, or token raises. After that, they rely on staking or restaking to generate yield and compound their positions.\n\nThis model increases balances but doesn\u2019t introduce new external capital into the asset. In other words, they\u2019re compounding what they already raised, not creating fresh demand.  \nOther holders are effectively diluted, not strengthened.\n\n* BitMine Immersion (BMNR) \u2013 Positions itself as an Ethereum treasury that earns staking yield and reinvests mining and operating revenue into more ETH accumulation.\n* ETHZilla (ETHZ) \u2013 Uses restaking and other ETH deployments, reinvesting part of those onchain yields into new ETH purchases.\n* SharpLink Gaming (SBET) \u2013 Tom Lee's company grows its ETH position through staking rewards while initial accumulation came from capital raises.\n\nIn all three cases, the \u201crevenue\u201d comes from the asset itself through staking rewards. These returns compound existing holdings but don\u2019t create new market demand for ETH.\n\n# SOL-Focused DATs\n\nIn the Solana ecosystem, Multicoin Capital is the closest analog to a DAT.  \nIts growth comes from venture capital inflows and early accumulation, with staking yield helping compound returns.\n\nLike Ethereum treasuries, it\u2019s an internal growth loop funded by investors, not business operations.  \nNo new external cash flow is entering SOL from real-world revenue.\n\n# The Other Guys\n\nSome companies have begun to hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but these are typically passive treasury strategies rather than active revenue-driven accumulation.\n\nFor example, Bit Origin has announced plans to build a Dogecoin treasury and is raising capital (equity and debt) to acquire DOGE. Other public companies hold DOGE as part of reserves, but there\u2019s no public evidence they are making ongoing purchases to increase those holdings like with see with MSTR.\n\nAs for LTC, MEI Pharma, Inc. (MEIP), a biotechnology company, purchased 929,548 LTC tokens in August 2025, using proceeds from a $100 million private placement to establish LTC as a core treasury asset.  They haven't made any subsequent purchases.\n\nDOGE and LTC treasuries show an interest in crypto assets being held by companies, but we haven't seen further accumulation like we've seen in BTC or larger alts.\n\n# Projects Buying-Back Their Token to Burn\n\nSome projects use revenue for buybacks and burns, but that\u2019s a very different dynamic.\n\nHyperliquid is the most notable and successful example, directing roughly 90 percent of its trading fees to buy back and burn its own token.\n\nThis creates onchain demand, but the purchases are internal to the protocol. There\u2019s no external business choosing to spend its revenue to accumulate the token, which to me is a bigger indication of belief in using digital assets as a treasury holding.\n\nBuyback-and-burn mechanisms help reduce supply, but they are not the same as a company with real-world income deciding to buy and hold tokens.\n\n# Businesses Using Revenue to Buy a Token\n\nAfter researching across different ecosystems, I could only find one company using revenue to buy a token. \n\nSafety Shot, initially a publicly traded beverage company, recently acquired a 10 percent revenue share in BONK.fun and an initial 25 million dollar position in BONK tokens. They added that they will reinvest roughly 90 percent of its revenue share into open-market BONK purchases, effectively tying its business success to the BONK ecosystem.\n\nThis is wild to me, as for many BONK is just a memecoin on Solana. However, BONK.fun, the BONK ecosystem\u2019s meme launchpad, already uses over 50% project revenue to buy back BONK and other top-performing tokens launched on its platform. \n\nI'd imagine Safety Shot saw BONK's revenue model and the platform pumping its token and saw an opportunity to get in early on the success. \n\nWhile we haven't seen TradFi companies do this with other buy-back-and-burn projects (Hyperliquid, deBridge, ApeX, etc), I think if Safety Shot has success it may be the blueprint.\n\n# tl;dr\n\n* BTC treasuries are the most common, but we are seeing other assets now being accumulated by TradFi\n* ETH and SOL treasuries grow primarily from staking yield on assets funded by earlier raises, compounding internally and diluting existing holders.\n* Some companies hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but they do so via capital deployment, not via business revenue.\n* Most altcoin DATs still rely on external funding or token sales to build their holdings.\n* BONK & Safety Shot is, so far, the only case I could find where a TradFi company is using its own revenue to actively buy a token on the open market.\n\nI expect over the next 1-2 years, we'll see an explosion of DATs across many different coins. Using revenue to buy tokens is a very interesting model, similar to stock buybacks.

I agreed and started to look into the issues but the more i saw about the project itself and overheard a phonecall with the woman who recruited him, i became more and more suspicious and i actually asked him about it and we began to talk about it and at quite an early point i had to admit that i was 99% sure that all of this was a scam and from there on we looked deeper and i also talked to that woman and after all of that i'm only even more convinced it's a scam. \n\nThe \"project\" is called \"Five Pillars Token\" and there are so many redflags imho... the numbers on CoinMarketCap do not add up, the whitepaper imho is not a whitepaper but just reads more like another marketing catalog. The whole appearance and the promises being made in addition to the whole \"recruiting\" part which is just screaming to be another scheme consisting of a pyramid scheme and lots and lots of techno babble to manipulate and convince especially interested people that do not have that much of a technical background for the whole cryptospace in particular. \n\nWith all of that being said, i would really love to get some help from people here who are \\*way\\* more in the know about the materia itself, especially because i would like to learn more, especially in \"how to identify if it's a scam with an incoming rugpull\" and how to distinguish projects that aren't. \n\nThe biggest red flags i think i have identified so far: \n\n1. Recruiting Scheme included  \n2. Numbers regarding Coins in Cicrulation do not add up  \n3. 99% of the coins are held by the top 10 wallets  \n4. 100% burning pool rate   \n5. Coin being \"backed\" and gaining value over time due to backing of real estates and invests in rare metals like gold in silver. What's interesting though is that the Board leader of the company \"Auvesta\" which is used for the rare metal investmens is being present at real life events of the team of this coin. Imho he is abusing the reputation of his company to just lure more investors into this scheme and just gets his part of the cake for doing so.   \n6.

In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 18:40:56", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o0nbhz/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.12858519404572033}

She\u2019s a senior living in Los Angeles and recently retired. A few months ago, a *bank employee* at **BMO** convinced her to \u201cinvest in crypto for better returns.\u201d Since the employee worked at her bank, she completely trusted her.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened step-by-step:\n\n1. The employee helped her open an account on [**Crypto.com**](http://Crypto.com) and buy cryptocurrency (Ethereum) using her BMO bank funds.\n2. Then the employee told her to download **Trust Wallet** and \u201ctransfer her crypto there to earn more.\u201d\n3. The employee personally guided her through the setup \u2014 and we now suspect she either saw or kept a copy of the **12-word recovery phrase** (the wallet\u2019s private key).\n4. My aunt was also instructed to connect to a site via the \u201cDApps / Discover\u201d tab in Trust Wallet, supposedly for \u201cstaking\u201d or \u201cearning interest.\u201d\n5. After a while, the employee told her that her \u201cinvestment had grown\u201d and that to **claim her big returns**, she needed to **deposit more money first**. My aunt did this *twice*, believing she was just adding to her balance so she could withdraw more later.\n6. Shortly after her second deposit, **the funds disappeared** from her wallet.\n7. The employee then **quit her job** at BMO, and the bank told us they \u201ccan\u2019t do anything because she\u2019s no longer employed.\u201d\n\nThe worst part is that **my aunt did all of this secretly**, without telling anyone in the family.

He was popular on the forums for a bit. He paid for ads there. \n\nFound two old exchanges I traded are that are bunk, C-Cex which is gone (scam phasing websites now replace them..). \n\nI had some amount of tips on ChangeTips that I couldn\u2019t access. \n\nI sent Riot games an email about how they should put background mining in the game as an opt in for free skins in 2013!! Like look at this\u2026 this is painful to read..\n\n> I would like to suggest that you create a feature that mines in the background of games on low power, on players computers. I am NOT suggesting that you do this \"secretly\". I'm suggesting that you could make a feature that you can turn on or off, and maybe compensates players with a little bonus RP or IP, or any other ideas you may have. Now, to talk numbers. I currently have a HP laptop with a basic Radeon graphics card, and I can mine at about 43 MHS (mega-hashes/second) at full power. So I could easily play league and mine at 0-5 MHS without noticing any performance difference. Now lets say you have 2 million players online at anytime, and 1 Million opt to have the mining in the background during a game on, averaging at 1 MHS (which is basically nothing by itself), But, with 1 million players running it, that would give you 1 Terra hash/second mining power, which at current price (bitcoin/usd) and difficulty is about 13-14,000 dollars a month in your pocket, and extra IP, RP, or whatever incentive you offer to the players in return.\n\n>Why am I suggesting this? Well there are three main reasons.\n1. As a part of the bitcoin community, I would like to see more exposure and more people learning about and using bitcoin, this would be a good opportunity for many people to learn about bitcoins and start using them.\n2. I would be okay with you using this idea with no personal compensation to me, although I would hope if you did implement it, you would give me some sort of personal gain, or allow me to work with your company on this system.\n3. As an avid player myself, I would enjoy the benefits of this system from a players perspective.\n\n>I'm just an 18 year old trying to make changes in the world, advocating for what I believe is a big part of the future. I am not with any company or anything, just a waiter at a local restaurant.\n\nI tried and sort of successfully set up a bitcoin faucet at some point, still trying to see if there\u2019s any scraps from that. I remember putting like $50 into the faucet. \n\nI found me pumping some shit coin on the Bitcoin talk threads. \n\nFound my eBay purchase of a USB miner for 17 bucks. I mined maybe $10 worth and flipped the miner back on eBay for $40ish. \n\n\n\nAll that goes to say that I basically have nothing left from it. I\u2019m proud of where crypto got but because of life I wasn\u2019t able to hold. It did help me get a car and a get my feet on the ground, but I completely missed the boat and am really struggling mentally with the day to day grind of life. Very nostalgic but also depressing.

We are currently witnessing the beginning of the end of the petrodollar era. What happens to the global monetary system when the US dollar loses its dominance and no credible successor emerges?\n\nThe world order is becoming multipolar economically, politically and technologically. This will also be reflected in monetary policy. In such a world, it is unlikely that a new national reserve currency, whether the euro, yuan, or a BRICS currency (LMAO) will simply replace the dollar\u2019s function. Much more likely is that Bitcoin will become the neutral, non-state reserve currency of a new era of a multipolar world.\n\nThe dollar is losing its position slowly but surely. US debt is over 35 trillion dollars and is growing exponentially. Monetary credibility is being undermined by aggressive quantitative easing policies. There is geopolitical use of the dollar payment system including sanctions and the weaponization of SWIFT. There are growing attempts at decoupling by BRICS, China, Russia, and ASEAN countries. The dollar will remain important for a long time but it is no longer unchallenged.\n\nWhy not simply use the yuan, euro, or a BRICS token?\n\nThe yuan has capital controls, lacks transparency and suffers from political unpredictability.\n\nThe euro suffers from fragmented fiscal policy, political disunity and lacks geopolitical projection.\n\nThe BRICS currency is ... come on, be serious lol\n\n\n\nAll of these fail at what once made the dollar strong, which is trust, liquidity and neutrality.\n\nBitcoin fulfills exactly this new role better than any national currency. Neutrality means that no government, corporation, or nation controls it. There are no sanctions, no printing presses, and no dependence on political moods. Bitcoin has a limited and credible supply of 21 million BTC, which is mathematically guaranteed. No trust is needed, only verification. Global access requires only an internet connection. States can trade bilaterally without clearing houses, SWIFT, or reserve currency dependency. Bitcoin\u2019s digital settlement infrastructure means it is natively digital. Scaling is possible via layer-2 solutions such as Lightning, sidechains, and programmable contracts. Interoperability with CBDCs and tokenization of real assets is also conceivable.\n\n\n\nA possible scenario is the establishment of a \u201cPetro-Bitcoin\u201d standard.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Russia, or Iran could sell their oil for BTC instead of the dollar. China or India could pay in BTC, bypassing dollar dependency. States could hold BTC in sovereign wealth funds or central bank vaults as protection against fiat depreciation. Multinational corporations could use BTC as a trade reserve currency.\n\nThus, a Bitcoin-based multilateral settlement system would gradually emerge that does not replace but supplements and ultimately displaces the existing system.\n\nCentral banks will hate it at first, then copy it, and finally integrate it.

{"id": "1o0s98g", "title": "Some Thoughts on a Recent Article by Aaron van Wirdum: Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots: What The OP_RETURN Debate Is Actually About", "selftext": "> Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots: What The OP_RETURN Debate Is Actually About\n> The OP_RETURN debate splits Bitcoin users: Bitcoin Core 30.0 allows data embedding, while Bitcoin Knots pushes back, fearing spam, rising fees, and regulatory risks.\n> \n> Aaron van Wirdum\n> By\n> Aaron van Wirdum\n> October 6, 2025\n> Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots\n> A new default setting in the upcoming Bitcoin Core release, Bitcoin Core 30.0, has caused a rift through segments of the Bitcoin community. Some users have indicated they won\u2019t upgrade to the new release of Bitcoin\u2019s most-used client, or switched to running Bitcoin Knots: a software fork of Bitcoin Core maintained by OCEAN CTO Luke Dashjr, a vocal critic of the change.\n> \n> The debate is quite technical, about a seemingly minor issue. Bitcoin Core 30.0 will start to relay transactions across the network with bigger OP_RETURN outputs: transactions that embed arbitrary data (like text or images) in a specific way. This appears to be a minor change because Bitcoin Core (and Bitcoin Knots) nodes do already accept these transactions once they\u2019re included in a block, while they also relay transactions that store arbitrary data in other ways.\n> \n> But the update has caused a rift because it reflects deeper concerns.\n> \n> The \u201cBitcoin Knots perspective\u201d\n> \n> Bitcoin Knots proponents generally dislike that transactions can contain arbitrary data, or as they usually call it, \u201cspam\u201d. But so far, most have begrudgingly accepted this as an unfortunate side effect of the Bitcoin protocol.\n> \n> They do believe this type of usage should be discouraged, however. When Bitcoin Core developers did this in the past by imposing a limit on the size of OP_RETURN outputs that nodes relayed, it indeed appeared to make some people decide to take these kinds of use cases to other cryptocurrencies instead of Bitcoin. (Most notably, this is commonly explained as the \u201corigin story\u201d of Ethereum.)\n> \n> The updated relay policy in Bitcoin Core 30.0 in their view symbolizes the end of such resistance. It signals to \u201cspammers\u201d that they are welcome on Bitcoin.\n> \n> One concern is that this will increasingly draw in this class of users and projects. And because Bitcoin block space is limited, using it for data storage will fill blocks up quickly, in turn driving up transaction fees, perhaps to the point where many regular (\u201cmonetary\u201d) transactions are priced out because of it.\n> \n> Another concern is that, even though arbitrary data can already be embedded in different ways, OP_RETURN makes it a bit easier to parse this data compared to other methods; it takes a little less effort to turn it into (say) an image. This, Bitcoin Knots proponents worry, also increases the risk that inclusion of illicit materials like CSAM (child sexual abuse material) could result in regulatory pressure on node operators.\n> \n> If the problem is that Bitcoin Core developers are not resisting the spammers, Bitcoin Knots represents this resistance. Even if they can\u2019t prevent arbitrary data from being included in the Bitcoin blockchain, or not prevent it completely, they at least won\u2019t help open up an additional avenue for it. In effect, they\u2019d be signaling that spam is not welcome, which they hope will have a discouraging effect.\n> \n> Assuming this discouraging effect succeeds in keeping the spammers at bay, Bitcoin Knots proponents say, Bitcoin can continue to be used for what it was originally intended: monetary transactions.\n\nThis is putting things mildly and leaves out the extreme attack scenarios where this is exploited with malice. \n\n> \n> The \u201cBitcoin Core perspective\u201d\n> \n> People can store arbitrary data on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain in various ways. Indeed, in recent years many people stored images in Inscriptions, and it could even be embedded in public or private keys.\n> \n> Most Bitcoin Core developers do agree with Bitcoin Knots proponents that none of this is great, and it\u2019s not what Bitcoin is intended for. But out of all these options, using OP_RETURN is the least harmful method, because it minimizes a computer\u2019s resource consumption, thus keeping nodes as affordable and accessible as possible.\n> \n> As such, Bitcoin Core developers figure that rather than trying to resist the use of OP_RETURN, it\u2019s better to just allow it; limiting probably only makes matters worse, and possibly much worse.\n> \n> For one, just refusing to relay these transactions technically doesn\u2019t achieve much. These same transactions could still be relayed by some other nodes, like Libre Relay nodes, or they can be submitted to miners directly to be included in blocks. This in turn could have a centralizing effect, as direct submission would presumably be done to larger miners disproportionately, who then benefit from the extra fee revenue at the expense of smaller miners. (There are also some nuanced detriments for nodes themselves if such transactions do make it into a block anyways.)\n> \n> The more robust solution \u2014 and arguably the logical next step \u2014 is to render (big) OP_RETURN transactions invalid through a consensus protocol upgrade (soft fork), so they can\u2019t get mined at all. But the problem with that, as already noted, is that people might use other, more harmful methods to store data on the blockchain. (In fact, many already prefer to use Inscriptions because this is significantly cheaper for bigger chunks of data like images.)\n> \n> In theory, some of these methods could be blocked as well. But most Bitcoin Core developers foresee that this will only lead to a game of whack-a-mole, with \u201cspammers\u201d resorting to different methods each time. It would incentivize them to \u201cdisguise\u201d their data like regular transactions, which could lead to a situation where monetary transactions and arbitrary data become increasingly indistinguishable from each other.\n\nyes, that would be great, we want that.\n\n> \n> The only solution left in this stage might be to designate some person or group to make judgement calls about which transactions are acceptable and which are not, in effect introducing some kind of entity that has the power to impose censorship. \n\nthis is a retarded ass take. \n\n>Bitcoin Core developers (themselves a rather amorphous group of contributors) have no interest in taking on such a role \u2014 not least because they don\u2019t wish to become a target for regulators that could force them to abuse this power \u2014 and prefer Bitcoin not to go down this path at all.\n> \n\nalso, dumb. they're afraid of one end of a pointy stick while swallowing it's other end.\n\n> Instead, they generally expect that the problem will resolve itself over time, without their interference.\n\nwell, they are interfering by changing the op return limit default...\n\n> \n> This is because a monetary transaction is relatively speaking a tiny bit of data. A single Bitcoin block can fit thousands of them. Other types of data tend to be much larger; just one image can fill up an entire block. This means that a single \u201cspammer\u201d typically has to outbid many regular users. Given enough demand for monetary transactions, using Bitcoin for data storage quickly becomes expensive. Arbitrary data should in this scenario be priced out and disappear organically.\n> \n\nnot really the actual concern.\n\n> Most Bitcoin Core developers agree that Bitcoin should be a network primarily for monetary transactions\u2014 but not because they\u2019ll actively resist other use cases, rather because this is how the incentives of the system already align.\n> \n\nno one cares about their words, we care about their actions.\n\n> So now what?\n> \n> Everyone is free to use whatever software they want, whether this is Bitcoin Core 30.0 (with or without touching this default setting), an older version of Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Knots, Libre Relay, or anything else. In this sense Bitcoin users are, in a very real way, sovereign.\n\ndefaults are sticky. they matter.\n\n> \n> Judging by sentiments on social media platforms like X, it does seem that some non-trivial segment of users won\u2019t upgrade to Bitcoin Core 30.0, or indeed switch to Bitcoin Knots. But it\u2019s impossible to tell how big of a share of Bitcoin\u2019s user base this really represents. It could be a large majority\u2026 or it could be a small (and loud) minority.\n> \n> Either way, Bitcoin does not operate like a democracy. Because every node typically relays transactions to multiple others, if even a relatively small minority of users choose to run Bitcoin Core 30.0 (or Libre Relay or something similar), larger OP_RETURNs should in fact propagate rather freely. This probably can\u2019t be stopped completely, but assuming Bitcoin Knots proponents want to at least meaningfully stifle this, they\u2019ll need to convince some supermajority of node operators (perhaps 95% or more) to join them in their filtering efforts.\n> \n> If they fail to do that, running Bitcoin Knots can be seen as a voice of dissent\u2014 but one with little practical effect.\n\nnot impressed with the illogical regurgitations in this article.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 21:43:44", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o0s98g/some_thoughts_on_a_recent_article_by_aaron_van/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.03947055589912733}

And there was more threads but lots of them got removed by mods and I got \"kicked out\" from some subs as well, that's how much people were against this back then.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of posts lately from people asking about buying Bitcoin on credit. In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 18:16:38", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o0mmqr/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.12858519404572033}

GalaxyBTC warns about big dips, crabbing and plenty of 'chop' but the structure is looking like we will see five digits ETH in the future. Other technical analysts are also seeing the same phenomenon. A confirmed V-bottom setup has a high success rate with 70-80% chances of long-term bullish reversals. The last time a setup like this happened was Bitcoin's 2018 recovery and this created years of growth as we all know.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uhvihm57motf1.jpg?width=2114&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc1e9811a137ddf617875afb10fe1609ac0cbe5d\n\nThe chart above is from GalaxyBTC's tweet and it also completes a huge triangle breakout pattern that has been in the making since 2021.

That was about to change..\n\nSince 20% of my port now was exposed indirectly to ETH, i forced myself to atleast try to understand. And boy was i in for a ride.. \n\nWeekly updates on eth aquired, new partnerships with onchain players, Staking, stablecoins, TVL etc. All of it, i understood: NADA COMPENDRE!\n\nBut what it did, was something special, it opened my eyes. This asset i knew next to nothing about was not just \"the next Bitcoin moonshot go sky boom wow!\" like my apeminded naive retail investor brain thesis. It was an economy. I can still picture myself sitting in my 14 year old office chair with no wheels (fallen off from abuse), and reading about 'Staking'. \"This highly volatile crypto asset pays me interest from securing its network, and all i have to do is hold it in a staking form.. wow\" i remember thinking.\n\nMy Argument is very simple, altough alot of these DATS will eventually fail/fade out/pivot from their original strategy. One thing they have already suceeded in is: getting Retail Retards (Like yours truly), to be curious. And it shows, we almost hit an ath in monthly active addresses in august according to gemini 19.45 MILLION active addresses was recorded in the month of august 2025. Closest we've come to the ATH's of 2021 with 20 million+. I myself is a living example of this argument. \n\nMy hope for the future of the ETH + DAT relationships is that they will do more than just Aquire/Stake and further their relationships to important onchain partner. Of course in the short term pumping our bags is always neat, but for the long term getting people onchain using this beautiful ecosystem and realizing the use for it.

How can we help them stake ETH properly?", "selftext": "The current market cycle has been characterized by the arrival of institutions, most recently in the form of DAT mania.\u00a0\n\nETH is obviously the best asset for DAT companies ... I don't need to get into why, I'm sure everyone here understands that.\n\nThese DATs are accumulating at rapid speed and almost all of them are staking or have signaled their intention to stake in the future.\u00a0\n\nThese types of institutions treat security as their top priority! In a recent [institutional survey by Obol](https://x.com/Obol_Collective/status/1973055949373141262), most of the biggest names in Ethereum staking indicated that security is a bigger concern than other variables like yield!\n\nCurrently, most major staking providers are exposed to single points of failure, correlated failures, and performance issues via legacy validator infrastructure. We all saw the recent security issue with Kiln which has spiked the exit que. This is a problem now when theres hundreds of billions at stake, but what happens when ETH is a multi-trillion dollar asset, with trillions at stake?\n\n**Interested in your opinions!**\n\n1. Should we be doing more as a community to push the existing staking providers to use Distributed Validators, as they are a more secure alternative compared to legacy validators?\n2. Should we be encouraging DATs to run their own staking nodes, instead of delegating their stake to the large centralized staking providers? Solo Staking, Squad Staking and even Rocketpool are great alternatives that foster decentralizing for Ethereum, while still ensuring these entities are meeting their security mandates.", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 16:28:14", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nznvga/new_survey_says_security_is_priority_1_for/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.2540886197136197}

{"id": "1nzfipg", "title": "Why stagflation and Fed rate cuts point toward owning assets like Ethereum.", "selftext": "So the U.S. economy is getting into uncharted territory, the Kobeissi Letter summed it up pretty well on Twitter: rate cuts are happening while core inflation is still a little over 2.9%. This is something that has not been seen in 30 years. Also on top of this the labor market outlook is getting weaker, deficit spending is well over $2 trillion annually and even jobs reports are on hold because of the government shutdown. And.. the Fed is not finished yet. Two more cuts are expected this year even as the U.S. is fighting against stagflation, slow growth mixed with high inflation. In the meantime tech giants are pouring over $100 billion every quarter into AI showing just how uneven the economy has become.\n\nWhat does this mean for us regular people?? Well the message is clear: hold assets or get left behind. Cash loses value when inflation stays sticky. Traditional bonds do not keep up when rates fall faster than prices. Assets that have independence from government policy, like ETH, stand out in this environment. As we all know well ETH is no longer just a speculative bet, it is increasingly being used as a reserve and settlement layer by institutions. If stagflation is here as it would seem then the old rule applies again: hard assets are the winner.. and for many more investors ETH is one of them.\n\nSource: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974092991842132271", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 10:39:01", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nzfipg/why_stagflation_and_fed_rate_cuts_point_toward/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.02591666666666667}

That is 330x more than what you will get for commenting in other communities and it will literally takes seconds of effort. But this is not all, if you make a post, you are looking at 836 DONUT minus 250 Pay2Post which is still an insane return.\n\nFurthermore to prevent spam and stress, we added a rule to max the reward to **42500 DONUT** currently around **$169.41** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xroj43bbfgtf1.png?width=1291&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e73150cb631bd86731a98ecf32d37875a754ff0\n\nIn summary, people are out there commenting and posting for Internet Magic Points called karma while losing the chance to do both and also earn DONUT that can be converted to real money.\n\nMy advice is to hold them because selling has a penalization if you sell more than 25% (I think) and because DONUT price right now is really cheap so you can even make more.\n\nSo here is the idea, register a wallet address, start commenting, start posting and watch your DONUT bags grow. **And of course always try to share quality content and don't spam**.

{"id": "1nx9wlo", "title": "New to crypto, looking for advice on my small ETH position", "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m still relatively new to the crypto world and currently only holding a small portfolio, around $1,800 in total. The biggest chunk of that is Ethereum, sitting at about $830. My average buy-in was around $4,300, which obviously isn\u2019t great. I basically bought near the top without much strategy. That being said, I\u2019m trying to learn and figure out a better plan for the future.\n\nRight now I also hold some Solana and XRP as my other two main positions. Nothing crazy, but they\u2019re the coins I felt somewhat comfortable with at this stage. I also have a tiny meme bag just for fun, but ETH is by far the largest part of my portfolio.\n\nHere\u2019s my actual question: does it make sense to sell my ETH position towards the end of this year, November or December, and then try to buy back in during a potential correction or dip next year? Or is that just trying to time the market, which everyone says is a bad idea, and I should just hold what I\u2019ve got?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my plan for 2026 is to invest much more seriously into both BTC and ETH. This current portfolio is really just a starting point. I don\u2019t mind holding for years, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to reposition better if there\u2019s a dip coming.\n\nWould love to hear what more experienced traders and investors here would do in my situation. Thanks a lot in advance for your perspectives, I really appreciate the input.\n\nTL;DR: New to crypto, small $1.8k portfolio, most in ETH bought at $4.3k avg.

But as materkel.eth explained it on Twitter, that myth needs to die. What is true in 2025 is clear: it is faster, cheaper and smarter to deploy a Layer 2 on Ethereum than to create a brand-new L1.\n\nThe math should be self-explanatory, data across the Ethereum network shows L2 transactions costing between $0.01 and $0.10 while L1 fees stay higher. Besides that maintaining an independent L1 means constant work on validators, security and upgrades. L2 teams escape most of that and only work on their product and incentives, the things that are actually bringing in users. Community sentiment evolved too, instead of rival chains discussion now centers on Ethereum's 'superchain' model, where different interconnected L2's reinforce one another while still benefiting from the security of Ethereum. That shared trust layer keeps the whole network stronger, not weaker.\n\nGoing back to the tweet posted by materkel, his view is that any sane CTO will launch an L2. With speed, cost and product attention being the highest values in this world, building yet another L1 is not innovation.. it is distraction.\n\nSource: https://x.com/materkel/status/1973710778092970096", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 12:33:27", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwxv7p/launching_a_new_l1_today_is_like_starting_a_new/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14431818181818185}

In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 19:19:40", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o0oeaj/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.12858519404572033}

I\u2019m so sad now.", "selftext": "Just went and dug through my old emails and what not. \n\nFound my buys and sells in 2012. \n\nFound where I purchased a virtual mining contract from PBMining and got scammed.. anyone else remember PBMining? He was popular on the forums for a bit. He paid for ads there. \n\nFound two old exchanges I traded are that are bunk, C-Cex which is gone (scam phasing websites now replace them..). \n\nI had some amount of tips on ChangeTips that I couldn\u2019t access. \n\nI sent Riot games an email about how they should put background mining in the game as an opt in for free skins in 2013!! Like look at this\u2026 this is painful to read..\n\n> I would like to suggest that you create a feature that mines in the background of games on low power, on players computers. I am NOT suggesting that you do this \"secretly\". I'm suggesting that you could make a feature that you can turn on or off, and maybe compensates players with a little bonus RP or IP, or any other ideas you may have. Now, to talk numbers. I currently have a HP laptop with a basic Radeon graphics card, and I can mine at about 43 MHS (mega-hashes/second) at full power. So I could easily play league and mine at 0-5 MHS without noticing any performance difference. Now lets say you have 2 million players online at anytime, and 1 Million opt to have the mining in the background during a game on, averaging at 1 MHS (which is basically nothing by itself), But, with 1 million players running it, that would give you 1 Terra hash/second mining power, which at current price (bitcoin/usd) and difficulty is about 13-14,000 dollars a month in your pocket, and extra IP, RP, or whatever incentive you offer to the players in return.\n\n>Why am I suggesting this? Well there are three main reasons.\n1. As a part of the bitcoin community, I would like to see more exposure and more people learning about and using bitcoin, this would be a good opportunity for many people to learn about bitcoins and start using them.\n2. I would be okay with you using this idea with no personal compensation to me, although I would hope if you did implement it, you would give me some sort of personal gain, or allow me to work with your company on this system.\n3. As an avid player myself, I would enjoy the benefits of this system from a players perspective.\n\n>I'm just an 18 year old trying to make changes in the world, advocating for what I believe is a big part of the future. I am not with any company or anything, just a waiter at a local restaurant.\n\nI tried and sort of successfully set up a bitcoin faucet at some point, still trying to see if there\u2019s any scraps from that. I remember putting like $50 into the faucet. \n\nI found me pumping some shit coin on the Bitcoin talk threads. \n\nFound my eBay purchase of a USB miner for 17 bucks. I mined maybe $10 worth and flipped the miner back on eBay for $40ish. \n\n\n\nAll that goes to say that I basically have nothing left from it. I\u2019m proud of where crypto got but because of life I wasn\u2019t able to hold. It did help me get a car and a get my feet on the ground, but I completely missed the boat and am really struggling mentally with the day to day grind of life. Very nostalgic but also depressing.

{"id": "1o0s90f", "title": "Deep Dive into non-BTC DATs", "selftext": "Everyone knows what MicroStrategy and Michael Saylor are doing with Bitcoin.  \nThe concept of a Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) has become one of the stronger narratives this cycle, with companies holding crypto directly on their balance sheets as a core strategy.\n\nWe all Bitcoin is king daddy of them all, but companies have been adding other alts to their balance sheet. As part of my mission to add more educational content to this sub, here are the companies that are accumulating other assets like ETH, SOL, or even meme tokens.\n\nAnd also, probably more importantly, the ones are doing it with real revenue and not just capital raises\n\n# ETH-Focused DATs\n\nMost Ethereum-based DATs fund their holdings through stock offerings, convertible debt, or token raises. After that, they rely on staking or restaking to generate yield and compound their positions.\n\nThis model increases balances but doesn\u2019t introduce new external capital into the asset. In other words, they\u2019re compounding what they already raised, not creating fresh demand.  \nOther holders are effectively diluted, not strengthened.\n\n* BitMine Immersion (BMNR) \u2013 Positions itself as an Ethereum treasury that earns staking yield and reinvests mining and operating revenue into more ETH accumulation.\n* ETHZilla (ETHZ) \u2013 Uses restaking and other ETH deployments, reinvesting part of those onchain yields into new ETH purchases.\n* SharpLink Gaming (SBET) \u2013 Tom Lee's company grows its ETH position through staking rewards while initial accumulation came from capital raises.\n\nIn all three cases, the \u201crevenue\u201d comes from the asset itself through staking rewards. These returns compound existing holdings but don\u2019t create new market demand for ETH.\n\n# SOL-Focused DATs\n\nIn the Solana ecosystem, Multicoin Capital is the closest analog to a DAT.  \nIts growth comes from venture capital inflows and early accumulation, with staking yield helping compound returns.\n\nLike Ethereum treasuries, it\u2019s an internal growth loop funded by investors, not business operations.  \nNo new external cash flow is entering SOL from real-world revenue.\n\n# The Other Guys\n\nSome companies have begun to hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but these are typically passive treasury strategies rather than active revenue-driven accumulation.\n\nFor example, Bit Origin has announced plans to build a Dogecoin treasury and is raising capital (equity and debt) to acquire DOGE. Other public companies hold DOGE as part of reserves, but there\u2019s no public evidence they are making ongoing purchases to increase those holdings like with see with MSTR.\n\nAs for LTC, MEI Pharma, Inc. (MEIP), a biotechnology company, purchased 929,548 LTC tokens in August 2025, using proceeds from a $100 million private placement to establish LTC as a core treasury asset.  They haven't made any subsequent purchases.\n\nDOGE and LTC treasuries show an interest in crypto assets being held by companies, but we haven't seen further accumulation like we've seen in BTC or larger alts.\n\n# Projects Buying-Back Their Token to Burn\n\nSome projects use revenue for buybacks and burns, but that\u2019s a very different dynamic.\n\nHyperliquid is the most notable and successful example, directing roughly 90 percent of its trading fees to buy back and burn its own token.\n\nThis creates onchain demand, but the purchases are internal to the protocol. There\u2019s no external business choosing to spend its revenue to accumulate the token, which to me is a bigger indication of belief in using digital assets as a treasury holding.\n\nBuyback-and-burn mechanisms help reduce supply, but they are not the same as a company with real-world income deciding to buy and hold tokens.\n\n# Businesses Using Revenue to Buy a Token\n\nAfter researching across different ecosystems, I could only find one company using revenue to buy a token. \n\nSafety Shot, initially a publicly traded beverage company, recently acquired a 10 percent revenue share in BONK.fun and an initial 25 million dollar position in BONK tokens. They added that they will reinvest roughly 90 percent of its revenue share into open-market BONK purchases, effectively tying its business success to the BONK ecosystem.\n\nThis is wild to me, as for many BONK is just a memecoin on Solana. However, BONK.fun, the BONK ecosystem\u2019s meme launchpad, already uses over 50% project revenue to buy back BONK and other top-performing tokens launched on its platform. \n\nI'd imagine Safety Shot saw BONK's revenue model and the platform pumping its token and saw an opportunity to get in early on the success. \n\nWhile we haven't seen TradFi companies do this with other buy-back-and-burn projects (Hyperliquid, deBridge, ApeX, etc), I think if Safety Shot has success it may be the blueprint.\n\n# tl;dr\n\n* BTC treasuries are the most common, but we are seeing other assets now being accumulated by TradFi\n* ETH and SOL treasuries grow primarily from staking yield on assets funded by earlier raises, compounding internally and diluting existing holders.\n* Some companies hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but they do so via capital deployment, not via business revenue.\n* Most altcoin DATs still rely on external funding or token sales to build their holdings.\n* BONK & Safety Shot is, so far, the only case I could find where a TradFi company is using its own revenue to actively buy a token on the open market.\n\nI expect over the next 1-2 years, we'll see an explosion of DATs across many different coins. Using revenue to buy tokens is a very interesting model, similar to stock buybacks.

It runs completely inside Discord.\n\nThe hook that got me was that you literally earn their in-game currency, called\u00a0`$TLR`, just by being active in chat or sitting in a voice channel. I figured that was it, just a simple little economy game.\n\nBut then I realized there's a whole second game buried in there. It's a full-on old-school RPG.

In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 18:40:56", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o0nbhz/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.12858519404572033}

She\u2019s a senior living in Los Angeles and recently retired. A few months ago, a *bank employee* at **BMO** convinced her to \u201cinvest in crypto for better returns.\u201d Since the employee worked at her bank, she completely trusted her.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened step-by-step:\n\n1. The employee helped her open an account on [**Crypto.com**](http://Crypto.com) and buy cryptocurrency (Ethereum) using her BMO bank funds.\n2. Then the employee told her to download **Trust Wallet** and \u201ctransfer her crypto there to earn more.\u201d\n3. The employee personally guided her through the setup \u2014 and we now suspect she either saw or kept a copy of the **12-word recovery phrase** (the wallet\u2019s private key).\n4. My aunt was also instructed to connect to a site via the \u201cDApps / Discover\u201d tab in Trust Wallet, supposedly for \u201cstaking\u201d or \u201cearning interest.\u201d\n5. After a while, the employee told her that her \u201cinvestment had grown\u201d and that to **claim her big returns**, she needed to **deposit more money first**. My aunt did this *twice*, believing she was just adding to her balance so she could withdraw more later.\n6. Shortly after her second deposit, **the funds disappeared** from her wallet.\n7. The employee then **quit her job** at BMO, and the bank told us they \u201ccan\u2019t do anything because she\u2019s no longer employed.\u201d\n\nThe worst part is that **my aunt did all of this secretly**, without telling anyone in the family. She truly thought she was investing wisely and surprising us later with good news. By the time we found out, it was too late.\n\nWe\u2019ve gathered:\n\n* Bank transaction records\n* [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) receipts and transfer logs\n* Trust Wallet transaction details\n* Screenshots and text messages between my aunt and the former employee\n\nThis was **her entire retirement savings**, and she\u2019s completely heartbroken.\n\nWe\u2019ve contacted BMO\u2019s fraud department, but they haven\u2019t been helpful so far. We\u2019re now preparing to report it to the **LAPD Financial Crimes Division**, **FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3.gov)**, and **Crypto.com\u2019s fraud team**.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Has anyone experienced something similar \u2014 especially scams involving *bank employees and crypto wallets*?\n* Is there any realistic way to trace or recover funds once they\u2019ve been drained from Trust Wallet?\n* Should we hire a lawyer \u2014 and if so, what kind? (Financial crimes, crypto fraud, or banking misconduct?)\n* How can we hold **BMO** accountable since their employee used her position to gain my aunt\u2019s trust and access her funds?\n\nWe\u2019d appreciate any advice or guidance.

I\u2019m so sad now.", "selftext": "Just went and dug through my old emails and what not. \n\nFound my buys and sells in 2014.\n\nFound where I purchased a virtual mining contract from PBMining and got scammed.. anyone else remember PBMining? He was popular on the forums for a bit. He paid for ads there. \n\nFound two old exchanges I traded are that are bunk, C-Cex which is gone (scam phasing websites now replace them..). \n\nI had some amount of tips on ChangeTips that I couldn\u2019t access. \n\nI sent Riot games an email about how they should put background mining in the game as an opt in for free skins in 2013!! Like look at this\u2026 this is painful to read..\n\n> I would like to suggest that you create a feature that mines in the background of games on low power, on players computers. I am NOT suggesting that you do this \"secretly\". I'm suggesting that you could make a feature that you can turn on or off, and maybe compensates players with a little bonus RP or IP, or any other ideas you may have. Now, to talk numbers. I currently have a HP laptop with a basic Radeon graphics card, and I can mine at about 43 MHS (mega-hashes/second) at full power. So I could easily play league and mine at 0-5 MHS without noticing any performance difference. Now lets say you have 2 million players online at anytime, and 1 Million opt to have the mining in the background during a game on, averaging at 1 MHS (which is basically nothing by itself), But, with 1 million players running it, that would give you 1 Terra hash/second mining power, which at current price (bitcoin/usd) and difficulty is about 13-14,000 dollars a month in your pocket, and extra IP, RP, or whatever incentive you offer to the players in return.\n\n>Why am I suggesting this? Well there are three main reasons.\n1. As a part of the bitcoin community, I would like to see more exposure and more people learning about and using bitcoin, this would be a good opportunity for many people to learn about bitcoins and start using them.\n2. I would be okay with you using this idea with no personal compensation to me, although I would hope if you did implement it, you would give me some sort of personal gain, or allow me to work with your company on this system.\n3. As an avid player myself, I would enjoy the benefits of this system from a players perspective.\n\n>I'm just an 18 year old trying to make changes in the world, advocating for what I believe is a big part of the future. I am not with any company or anything, just a waiter at a local restaurant.\n\nI tried and sort of successfully set up a bitcoin faucet at some point, still trying to see if there\u2019s any scraps from that. I remember putting like $50 into the faucet. \n\nI found me pumping some shit coin on the Bitcoin talk threads. \n\nFound my eBay purchase of a USB miner for 17 bucks. I mined maybe $10 worth and flipped the miner back on eBay for $40ish. \n\n\n\nAll that goes to say that I basically have nothing left from it. I\u2019m proud of where crypto got but because of life I wasn\u2019t able to hold. It did help me get a car and a get my feet on the ground, but I completely missed the boat and am really struggling mentally with the day to day grind of life. Very nostalgic but also depressing.

Think of GTA, Halo, Detroit becomes Human, Visual Novels, anime related games etc. Personally I think it's a huge invasion of privacy, no one should care about what you purchase but yourself the individual, and there shouldn't be a payment processor like Master Card or Visa to stop you from purchasing a game that you want.\n\nAs you can imagine a lot of gaming subs were pissed myself included but when I suggested we convince Valve to allow us to pay in bitcoin, I ended up getting downvoted to oblivion despite it being the perfect way to purchase your game from client to provider.

We are currently witnessing the beginning of the end of the petrodollar era. What happens to the global monetary system when the US dollar loses its dominance and no credible successor emerges?\n\nThe world order is becoming multipolar economically, politically and technologically. This will also be reflected in monetary policy. In such a world, it is unlikely that a new national reserve currency, whether the euro, yuan, or a BRICS currency (LMAO) will simply replace the dollar\u2019s function. Much more likely is that Bitcoin will become the neutral, non-state reserve currency of a new era of a multipolar world.\n\nThe dollar is losing its position slowly but surely. US debt is over 35 trillion dollars and is growing exponentially. Monetary credibility is being undermined by aggressive quantitative easing policies. There is geopolitical use of the dollar payment system including sanctions and the weaponization of SWIFT. There are growing attempts at decoupling by BRICS, China, Russia, and ASEAN countries. The dollar will remain important for a long time but it is no longer unchallenged.\n\nWhy not simply use the yuan, euro, or a BRICS token?\n\nThe yuan has capital controls, lacks transparency and suffers from political unpredictability.\n\nThe euro suffers from fragmented fiscal policy, political disunity and lacks geopolitical projection.\n\nThe BRICS currency is ... come on, be serious lol\n\n\n\nAll of these fail at what once made the dollar strong, which is trust, liquidity and neutrality.\n\nBitcoin fulfills exactly this new role better than any national currency. Neutrality means that no government, corporation, or nation controls it. There are no sanctions, no printing presses, and no dependence on political moods. Bitcoin has a limited and credible supply of 21 million BTC, which is mathematically guaranteed. No trust is needed, only verification. Global access requires only an internet connection. States can trade bilaterally without clearing houses, SWIFT, or reserve currency dependency. Bitcoin\u2019s digital settlement infrastructure means it is natively digital. Scaling is possible via layer-2 solutions such as Lightning, sidechains, and programmable contracts. Interoperability with CBDCs and tokenization of real assets is also conceivable.\n\n\n\nA possible scenario is the establishment of a \u201cPetro-Bitcoin\u201d standard.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Russia, or Iran could sell their oil for BTC instead of the dollar. China or India could pay in BTC, bypassing dollar dependency. States could hold BTC in sovereign wealth funds or central bank vaults as protection against fiat depreciation. Multinational corporations could use BTC as a trade reserve currency.\n\nThus, a Bitcoin-based multilateral settlement system would gradually emerge that does not replace but supplements and ultimately displaces the existing system.\n\nCentral banks will hate it at first, then copy it, and finally integrate it. Bitcoin is to central banks what the internet was to governments. it is too disruptive to ignore and too powerful to ban.\n\nThe first signs are already visible.\n\nWe are at the beginning of monetary de-dollarization, and Bitcoin is the first neutral asset that is liquid, limited, global, immutable, and non-state-backed.\n\nNot despite but precisely because of its independence, Bitcoin is the natural asset for a new multipolar monetary order.\n\n\u201cBitcoin fixes this\u201d is not a meme", "created_utc": "2025-10-08 02:48:51", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o0z2yu/bitcoin_as_the_reserve_currency_of_a_multipolar/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.04842899036447423}

Some users have indicated they won\u2019t upgrade to the new release of Bitcoin\u2019s most-used client, or switched to running Bitcoin Knots: a software fork of Bitcoin Core maintained by OCEAN CTO Luke Dashjr, a vocal critic of the change.\n> \n> The debate is quite technical, about a seemingly minor issue. Bitcoin Core 30.0 will start to relay transactions across the network with bigger OP_RETURN outputs: transactions that embed arbitrary data (like text or images) in a specific way. This appears to be a minor change because Bitcoin Core (and Bitcoin Knots) nodes do already accept these transactions once they\u2019re included in a block, while they also relay transactions that store arbitrary data in other ways.\n> \n> But the update has caused a rift because it reflects deeper concerns.\n> \n> The \u201cBitcoin Knots perspective\u201d\n> \n> Bitcoin Knots proponents generally dislike that transactions can contain arbitrary data, or as they usually call it, \u201cspam\u201d. But so far, most have begrudgingly accepted this as an unfortunate side effect of the Bitcoin protocol.\n> \n> They do believe this type of usage should be discouraged, however. When Bitcoin Core developers did this in the past by imposing a limit on the size of OP_RETURN outputs that nodes relayed, it indeed appeared to make some people decide to take these kinds of use cases to other cryptocurrencies instead of Bitcoin. (Most notably, this is commonly explained as the \u201corigin story\u201d of Ethereum.)\n> \n> The updated relay policy in Bitcoin Core 30.0 in their view symbolizes the end of such resistance. It signals to \u201cspammers\u201d that they are welcome on Bitcoin.\n> \n> One concern is that this will increasingly draw in this class of users and projects. And because Bitcoin block space is limited, using it for data storage will fill blocks up quickly, in turn driving up transaction fees, perhaps to the point where many regular (\u201cmonetary\u201d) transactions are priced out because of it.\n> \n> Another concern is that, even though arbitrary data can already be embedded in different ways, OP_RETURN makes it a bit easier to parse this data compared to other methods; it takes a little less effort to turn it into (say) an image. This, Bitcoin Knots proponents worry, also increases the risk that inclusion of illicit materials like CSAM (child sexual abuse material) could result in regulatory pressure on node operators.\n> \n> If the problem is that Bitcoin Core developers are not resisting the spammers, Bitcoin Knots represents this resistance. Even if they can\u2019t prevent arbitrary data from being included in the Bitcoin blockchain, or not prevent it completely, they at least won\u2019t help open up an additional avenue for it. In effect, they\u2019d be signaling that spam is not welcome, which they hope will have a discouraging effect.\n> \n> Assuming this discouraging effect succeeds in keeping the spammers at bay, Bitcoin Knots proponents say, Bitcoin can continue to be used for what it was originally intended: monetary transactions.\n\nThis is putting things mildly and leaves out the extreme attack scenarios where this is exploited with malice. \n\n> \n> The \u201cBitcoin Core perspective\u201d\n> \n> People can store arbitrary data on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain in various ways. Indeed, in recent years many people stored images in Inscriptions, and it could even be embedded in public or private keys.\n> \n> Most Bitcoin Core developers do agree with Bitcoin Knots proponents that none of this is great, and it\u2019s not what Bitcoin is intended for. But out of all these options, using OP_RETURN is the least harmful method, because it minimizes a computer\u2019s resource consumption, thus keeping nodes as affordable and accessible as possible.\n> \n> As such, Bitcoin Core developers figure that rather than trying to resist the use of OP_RETURN, it\u2019s better to just allow it; limiting probably only makes matters worse, and possibly much worse.\n> \n> For one, just refusing to relay these transactions technically doesn\u2019t achieve much. These same transactions could still be relayed by some other nodes, like Libre Relay nodes, or they can be submitted to miners directly to be included in blocks. This in turn could have a centralizing effect, as direct submission would presumably be done to larger miners disproportionately, who then benefit from the extra fee revenue at the expense of smaller miners. (There are also some nuanced detriments for nodes themselves if such transactions do make it into a block anyways.)\n> \n> The more robust solution \u2014 and arguably the logical next step \u2014 is to render (big) OP_RETURN transactions invalid through a consensus protocol upgrade (soft fork), so they can\u2019t get mined at all. But the problem with that, as already noted, is that people might use other, more harmful methods to store data on the blockchain. (In fact, many already prefer to use Inscriptions because this is significantly cheaper for bigger chunks of data like images.)\n> \n> In theory, some of these methods could be blocked as well. But most Bitcoin Core developers foresee that this will only lead to a game of whack-a-mole, with \u201cspammers\u201d resorting to different methods each time. It would incentivize them to \u201cdisguise\u201d their data like regular transactions, which could lead to a situation where monetary transactions and arbitrary data become increasingly indistinguishable from each other.\n\nyes, that would be great, we want that.\n\n> \n> The only solution left in this stage might be to designate some person or group to make judgement calls about which transactions are acceptable and which are not, in effect introducing some kind of entity that has the power to impose censorship. \n\nthis is a retarded ass take. \n\n>Bitcoin Core developers (themselves a rather amorphous group of contributors) have no interest in taking on such a role \u2014 not least because they don\u2019t wish to become a target for regulators that could force them to abuse this power \u2014 and prefer Bitcoin not to go down this path at all.\n> \n\nalso, dumb. they're afraid of one end of a pointy stick while swallowing it's other end.\n\n> Instead, they generally expect that the problem will resolve itself over time, without their interference.\n\nwell, they are interfering by changing the op return limit default...\n\n> \n> This is because a monetary transaction is relatively speaking a tiny bit of data. A single Bitcoin block can fit thousands of them. Other types of data tend to be much larger; just one image can fill up an entire block. This means that a single \u201cspammer\u201d typically has to outbid many regular users. Given enough demand for monetary transactions, using Bitcoin for data storage quickly becomes expensive. Arbitrary data should in this scenario be priced out and disappear organically.\n> \n\nnot really the actual concern.\n\n> Most Bitcoin Core developers agree that Bitcoin should be a network primarily for monetary transactions\u2014 but not because they\u2019ll actively resist other use cases, rather because this is how the incentives of the system already align.\n> \n\nno one cares about their words, we care about their actions.\n\n> So now what?\n> \n> Everyone is free to use whatever software they want, whether this is Bitcoin Core 30.0 (with or without touching this default setting), an older version of Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Knots, Libre Relay, or anything else. In this sense Bitcoin users are, in a very real way, sovereign.\n\ndefaults are sticky. they matter.\n\n> \n> Judging by sentiments on social media platforms like X, it does seem that some non-trivial segment of users won\u2019t upgrade to Bitcoin Core 30.0, or indeed switch to Bitcoin Knots. But it\u2019s impossible to tell how big of a share of Bitcoin\u2019s user base this really represents. It could be a large majority\u2026 or it could be a small (and loud) minority.\n> \n> Either way, Bitcoin does not operate like a democracy. Because every node typically relays transactions to multiple others, if even a relatively small minority of users choose to run Bitcoin Core 30.0 (or Libre Relay or something similar), larger OP_RETURNs should in fact propagate rather freely. This probably can\u2019t be stopped completely, but assuming Bitcoin Knots proponents want to at least meaningfully stifle this, they\u2019ll need to convince some supermajority of node operators (perhaps 95% or more) to join them in their filtering efforts.\n> \n> If they fail to do that, running Bitcoin Knots can be seen as a voice of dissent\u2014 but one with little practical effect.\n\nnot impressed with the illogical regurgitations in this article.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 21:43:44", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o0s98g/some_thoughts_on_a_recent_article_by_aaron_van/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.03947055589912733}

And there was more threads but lots of them got removed by mods and I got \"kicked out\" from some subs as well, that's how much people were against this back then.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of posts lately from people asking about buying Bitcoin on credit. In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc.

On Twitter, GalaxyBTC described how ETH has 'successfully retested the V-bottom structure and the big triangle from 2021' calling for a continued bull run into 2026. The setup is not perfect however, we need to buckle up for big price drops. GalaxyBTC warns about big dips, crabbing and plenty of 'chop' but the structure is looking like we will see five digits ETH in the future. Other technical analysts are also seeing the same phenomenon. A confirmed V-bottom setup has a high success rate with 70-80% chances of long-term bullish reversals. The last time a setup like this happened was Bitcoin's 2018 recovery and this created years of growth as we all know.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uhvihm57motf1.jpg?width=2114&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc1e9811a137ddf617875afb10fe1609ac0cbe5d\n\nThe chart above is from GalaxyBTC's tweet and it also completes a huge triangle breakout pattern that has been in the making since 2021. Combined with rising institutional demand and steady on-chain activity this supports the idea that ETH is not done yet, only taking a break before the next leg up.\n\nPredictions are a little different.

(onchain)", "selftext": "When i, in the start of July invested my hard earned money in a recently established ETH DAT, none of my money was onchain. In fact it had never been onchain and i had no plans for that to change. My investment was to get exposure to eth through the DAT, an asset i knew next to nothing about except: crypto=UP FAST + Blockchain good wow. That was about to change..\n\nSince 20% of my port now was exposed indirectly to ETH, i forced myself to atleast try to understand. And boy was i in for a ride.. \n\nWeekly updates on eth aquired, new partnerships with onchain players, Staking, stablecoins, TVL etc. All of it, i understood: NADA COMPENDRE!\n\nBut what it did, was something special, it opened my eyes. This asset i knew next to nothing about was not just \"the next Bitcoin moonshot go sky boom wow!\" like my apeminded naive retail investor brain thesis. It was an economy. I can still picture myself sitting in my 14 year old office chair with no wheels (fallen off from abuse), and reading about 'Staking'. \"This highly volatile crypto asset pays me interest from securing its network, and all i have to do is hold it in a staking form.. wow\" i remember thinking.\n\nMy Argument is very simple, altough alot of these DATS will eventually fail/fade out/pivot from their original strategy. One thing they have already suceeded in is: getting Retail Retards (Like yours truly), to be curious. And it shows, we almost hit an ath in monthly active addresses in august according to gemini 19.45 MILLION active addresses was recorded in the month of august 2025. Closest we've come to the ATH's of 2021 with 20 million+. I myself is a living example of this argument. \n\nMy hope for the future of the ETH + DAT relationships is that they will do more than just Aquire/Stake and further their relationships to important onchain partner. Of course in the short term pumping our bags is always neat, but for the long term getting people onchain using this beautiful ecosystem and realizing the use for it. Is what will bring us prosperity in the end. \n\nTLDR: DAT's Pump our bags, but most importantly bring awareness of the uses of ETH, i myself is a DAT RETARD RETAIL investor turned onchain obeyer.\n\nSincerely Fatkid13yrsold, former Retard Retailer turned Onchain Obeyer and Believer in somETHing.\n\n", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 11:06:44", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1o0bojq/dats_what_are_they_good_for_onchain/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.06192400192400191}

This is something that has not been seen in 30 years. Also on top of this the labor market outlook is getting weaker, deficit spending is well over $2 trillion annually and even jobs reports are on hold because of the government shutdown. And.. the Fed is not finished yet. Two more cuts are expected this year even as the U.S. is fighting against stagflation, slow growth mixed with high inflation. In the meantime tech giants are pouring over $100 billion every quarter into AI showing just how uneven the economy has become.\n\nWhat does this mean for us regular people?? Well the message is clear: hold assets or get left behind. Cash loses value when inflation stays sticky. Traditional bonds do not keep up when rates fall faster than prices. Assets that have independence from government policy, like ETH, stand out in this environment. As we all know well ETH is no longer just a speculative bet, it is increasingly being used as a reserve and settlement layer by institutions. If stagflation is here as it would seem then the old rule applies again: hard assets are the winner.. and for many more investors ETH is one of them.\n\nSource: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974092991842132271", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 10:39:01", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nzfipg/why_stagflation_and_fed_rate_cuts_point_toward/", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.02591666666666667}
{"id": "1nzdxg8", "title": "Stop Sleeping: People Are Missing Out on Easy DONUT Gains", "selftext": "Okay, lets get real for a second guys, people are sleeping on the DONUT game being played here at r/ethtrader and I am just going to show you why.\n\nIf you have been casually commenting or posting in r/ethtrader community, you might not realize that you can earn a good chunk of DONUT without even breaking a sweat.\n\nLet's share some data from [last distribution cycle ](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nql0b2/donut_distribution_data_for_round_154_final_csv/)\n\n* **Max DONUT you can earn:** 42,500\n* **Comment ratio:** 330.22 per tip (from a full weight user - dont worry about this right now)\n* **Post ratio:** 836.64 per post\n* **Pay2post ratio:** 250 DONUT (fee deducted from your final distribution after some calculations taking in count flair - don't worry about this right now)\n\nIn other words, if someone tips you 1 DONUT in a comment you made in r/ethtrader and you are eligible and have registered a wallet, you get 330 DONUT back. That is 330x more than what you will get for commenting in other communities and it will literally takes seconds of effort. But this is not all, if you make a post, you are looking at 836 DONUT minus 250 Pay2Post which is still an insane return.\n\nFurthermore to prevent spam and stress, we added a rule to max the reward to **42500 DONUT** currently around **$169.41** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/usd)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xroj43bbfgtf1.png?width=1291&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e73150cb631bd86731a98ecf32d37875a754ff0\n\nIn summary, people are out there commenting and posting for Internet Magic Points called karma while losing the chance to do both and also earn DONUT that can be converted to real money.\n\nMy advice is to hold them because selling has a penalization if you sell more than 25% (I think) and because DONUT price right now is really cheap so you can even make more.\n\nSo here is the idea, register a wallet address, start commenting, start posting and watch your DONUT bags grow. **And of course always try to share quality content and don't spam**. Just enjoy the community with one account and I assure you that your future will be better.\n\n# \ud83e\ude99 How to make others earn DONUT\n\nThis one is simple, if you want to reward someone's comment or post because you liked it or feel like it deserves it you just need to write the following command in the comment replacing NUMBER by the amount you want to tip\n\n`!tip NUMBER`\n\nIts important to say that this tips will be deducted from the ones you will earn in the incoming distribution. Same with pay to post and even if you end in negative no one will make you pay them.\n\n# \ud83d\udc5b How to register a wallet address\n\nYou can just comment the following command replacing wallet address by yours and you will register\n\n`!register <wallet address>`\n\nOr you can do it in [https://donutdao.org/](https://donutdao.org/) (scroll to the bottom to see the register part)\n\n# \ud83c\udfea How to Buy DONUT\n\nEven thought the team is working hard to get DONUT listed in a CEX (DONUT had an audit to improve the chances to be listed) we still are only on DEX. To buy DONUT is quite simple and depends on the Network:\n\n* For Ethereum Network you can buy them at Uniswap\u00a0[https://app.uniswap.org/swap?outputCurrency=0xC0F9bD5Fa5698B6505F643900FFA515Ea5dF54A9](https://app.uniswap.org/swap?outputCurrency=0xC0F9bD5Fa5698B6505F643900FFA515Ea5dF54A9)\n* For Arbitrum One you can buy them at Sushiswap:\u00a0[https://www.sushi.com/arbitrum/swap?token0=NATIVE&token1=0xF42e2B8bc2aF8B110b65be98dB1321B1ab8D44f5](https://www.sushi.com/arbitrum/swap?token0=NATIVE&token1=0xF42e2B8bc2aF8B110b65be98dB1321B1ab8D44f5)\n\n# \ud83d\udd14 Tip\n\nAsk any kind of doubt in the daily post, community will always try to help you.\n\nLet's turn this into the fastest growing DONUT gang on Reddit.", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 08:57:58", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nzdxg8/stop_sleeping_people_are_missing_out_on_easy/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.10354308390022672}

The biggest chunk of that is Ethereum, sitting at about $830. My average buy-in was around $4,300, which obviously isn\u2019t great. I basically bought near the top without much strategy. That being said, I\u2019m trying to learn and figure out a better plan for the future.\n\nRight now I also hold some Solana and XRP as my other two main positions. Nothing crazy, but they\u2019re the coins I felt somewhat comfortable with at this stage. I also have a tiny meme bag just for fun, but ETH is by far the largest part of my portfolio.\n\nHere\u2019s my actual question: does it make sense to sell my ETH position towards the end of this year, November or December, and then try to buy back in during a potential correction or dip next year? Or is that just trying to time the market, which everyone says is a bad idea, and I should just hold what I\u2019ve got?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my plan for 2026 is to invest much more seriously into both BTC and ETH. This current portfolio is really just a starting point. I don\u2019t mind holding for years, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to reposition better if there\u2019s a dip coming.\n\nWould love to hear what more experienced traders and investors here would do in my situation. Thanks a lot in advance for your perspectives, I really appreciate the input.\n\nTL;DR: New to crypto, small $1.8k portfolio, most in ETH bought at $4.3k avg.

But as materkel.eth explained it on Twitter, that myth needs to die. What is true in 2025 is clear: it is faster, cheaper and smarter to deploy a Layer 2 on Ethereum than to create a brand-new L1.\n\nThe math should be self-explanatory, data across the Ethereum network shows L2 transactions costing between $0.01 and $0.10 while L1 fees stay higher. Besides that maintaining an independent L1 means constant work on validators, security and upgrades. L2 teams escape most of that and only work on their product and incentives, the things that are actually bringing in users. Community sentiment evolved too, instead of rival chains discussion now centers on Ethereum's 'superchain' model, where different interconnected L2's reinforce one another while still benefiting from the security of Ethereum. That shared trust layer keeps the whole network stronger, not weaker.\n\nGoing back to the tweet posted by materkel, his view is that any sane CTO will launch an L2. With speed, cost and product attention being the highest values in this world, building yet another L1 is not innovation.. it is distraction.\n\nSource: https://x.com/materkel/status/1973710778092970096", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 12:33:27", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwxv7p/launching_a_new_l1_today_is_like_starting_a_new/", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14431818181818185}

In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc.

He was popular on the forums for a bit. He paid for ads there. \n\nFound two old exchanges I traded are that are bunk, C-Cex which is gone (scam phasing websites now replace them..). \n\nI had some amount of tips on ChangeTips that I couldn\u2019t access. \n\nI sent Riot games an email about how they should put background mining in the game as an opt in for free skins in 2013!! Like look at this\u2026 this is painful to read..\n\n> I would like to suggest that you create a feature that mines in the background of games on low power, on players computers. I am NOT suggesting that you do this \"secretly\". I'm suggesting that you could make a feature that you can turn on or off, and maybe compensates players with a little bonus RP or IP, or any other ideas you may have. Now, to talk numbers. I currently have a HP laptop with a basic Radeon graphics card, and I can mine at about 43 MHS (mega-hashes/second) at full power. So I could easily play league and mine at 0-5 MHS without noticing any performance difference. Now lets say you have 2 million players online at anytime, and 1 Million opt to have the mining in the background during a game on, averaging at 1 MHS (which is basically nothing by itself), But, with 1 million players running it, that would give you 1 Terra hash/second mining power, which at current price (bitcoin/usd) and difficulty is about 13-14,000 dollars a month in your pocket, and extra IP, RP, or whatever incentive you offer to the players in return.\n\n>Why am I suggesting this? Well there are three main reasons.\n1. As a part of the bitcoin community, I would like to see more exposure and more people learning about and using bitcoin, this would be a good opportunity for many people to learn about bitcoins and start using them.\n2. I would be okay with you using this idea with no personal compensation to me, although I would hope if you did implement it, you would give me some sort of personal gain, or allow me to work with your company on this system.\n3. As an avid player myself, I would enjoy the benefits of this system from a players perspective.\n\n>I'm just an 18 year old trying to make changes in the world, advocating for what I believe is a big part of the future. I am not with any company or anything, just a waiter at a local restaurant.\n\nI tried and sort of successfully set up a bitcoin faucet at some point, still trying to see if there\u2019s any scraps from that. I remember putting like $50 into the faucet. \n\nI found me pumping some shit coin on the Bitcoin talk threads. \n\nFound my eBay purchase of a USB miner for 17 bucks. I mined maybe $10 worth and flipped the miner back on eBay for $40ish. \n\n\n\nAll that goes to say that I basically have nothing left from it. I\u2019m proud of where crypto got but because of life I wasn\u2019t able to hold. It did help me get a car and a get my feet on the ground, but I completely missed the boat and am really struggling mentally with the day to day grind of life. Very nostalgic but also depressing.

{"id": "1o0s90f", "title": "Deep Dive into non-BTC DATs", "selftext": "Everyone knows what MicroStrategy and Michael Saylor are doing with Bitcoin.  \nThe concept of a Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) has become one of the stronger narratives this cycle, with companies holding crypto directly on their balance sheets as a core strategy.\n\nWe all Bitcoin is king daddy of them all, but companies have been adding other alts to their balance sheet. As part of my mission to add more educational content to this sub, here are the companies that are accumulating other assets like ETH, SOL, or even meme tokens.\n\nAnd also, probably more importantly, the ones are doing it with real revenue and not just capital raises\n\n# ETH-Focused DATs\n\nMost Ethereum-based DATs fund their holdings through stock offerings, convertible debt, or token raises. After that, they rely on staking or restaking to generate yield and compound their positions.\n\nThis model increases balances but doesn\u2019t introduce new external capital into the asset. In other words, they\u2019re compounding what they already raised, not creating fresh demand.  \nOther holders are effectively diluted, not strengthened.\n\n* BitMine Immersion (BMNR) \u2013 Positions itself as an Ethereum treasury that earns staking yield and reinvests mining and operating revenue into more ETH accumulation.\n* ETHZilla (ETHZ) \u2013 Uses restaking and other ETH deployments, reinvesting part of those onchain yields into new ETH purchases.\n* SharpLink Gaming (SBET) \u2013 Tom Lee's company grows its ETH position through staking rewards while initial accumulation came from capital raises.\n\nIn all three cases, the \u201crevenue\u201d comes from the asset itself through staking rewards. These returns compound existing holdings but don\u2019t create new market demand for ETH.\n\n# SOL-Focused DATs\n\nIn the Solana ecosystem, Multicoin Capital is the closest analog to a DAT.  \nIts growth comes from venture capital inflows and early accumulation, with staking yield helping compound returns.\n\nLike Ethereum treasuries, it\u2019s an internal growth loop funded by investors, not business operations.  \nNo new external cash flow is entering SOL from real-world revenue.\n\n# The Other Guys\n\nSome companies have begun to hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but these are typically passive treasury strategies rather than active revenue-driven accumulation.\n\nFor example, Bit Origin has announced plans to build a Dogecoin treasury and is raising capital (equity and debt) to acquire DOGE. Other public companies hold DOGE as part of reserves, but there\u2019s no public evidence they are making ongoing purchases to increase those holdings like with see with MSTR.\n\nAs for LTC, MEI Pharma, Inc. (MEIP), a biotechnology company, purchased 929,548 LTC tokens in August 2025, using proceeds from a $100 million private placement to establish LTC as a core treasury asset.  They haven't made any subsequent purchases.\n\nDOGE and LTC treasuries show an interest in crypto assets being held by companies, but we haven't seen further accumulation like we've seen in BTC or larger alts.\n\n# Projects Buying-Back Their Token to Burn\n\nSome projects use revenue for buybacks and burns, but that\u2019s a very different dynamic.\n\nHyperliquid is the most notable and successful example, directing roughly 90 percent of its trading fees to buy back and burn its own token.\n\nThis creates onchain demand, but the purchases are internal to the protocol. There\u2019s no external business choosing to spend its revenue to accumulate the token, which to me is a bigger indication of belief in using digital assets as a treasury holding.\n\nBuyback-and-burn mechanisms help reduce supply, but they are not the same as a company with real-world income deciding to buy and hold tokens.\n\n# Businesses Using Revenue to Buy a Token\n\nAfter researching across different ecosystems, I could only find one company using revenue to buy a token. \n\nSafety Shot, initially a publicly traded beverage company, recently acquired a 10 percent revenue share in BONK.fun and an initial 25 million dollar position in BONK tokens. They added that they will reinvest roughly 90 percent of its revenue share into open-market BONK purchases, effectively tying its business success to the BONK ecosystem.\n\nThis is wild to me, as for many BONK is just a memecoin on Solana. However, BONK.fun, the BONK ecosystem\u2019s meme launchpad, already uses over 50% project revenue to buy back BONK and other top-performing tokens launched on its platform. \n\nI'd imagine Safety Shot saw BONK's revenue model and the platform pumping its token and saw an opportunity to get in early on the success. \n\nWhile we haven't seen TradFi companies do this with other buy-back-and-burn projects (Hyperliquid, deBridge, ApeX, etc), I think if Safety Shot has success it may be the blueprint.\n\n# tl;dr\n\n* BTC treasuries are the most common, but we are seeing other assets now being accumulated by TradFi\n* ETH and SOL treasuries grow primarily from staking yield on assets funded by earlier raises, compounding internally and diluting existing holders.\n* Some companies hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but they do so via capital deployment, not via business revenue.\n* Most altcoin DATs still rely on external funding or token sales to build their holdings.\n* BONK & Safety Shot is, so far, the only case I could find where a TradFi company is using its own revenue to actively buy a token on the open market.\n\nI expect over the next 1-2 years, we'll see an explosion of DATs across many different coins. Using revenue to buy tokens is a very interesting model, similar to stock buybacks.

It runs completely inside Discord.\n\nThe hook that got me was that you literally earn their in-game currency, called\u00a0`$TLR`, just by being active in chat or sitting in a voice channel. I figured that was it, just a simple little economy game.\n\nBut then I realized there's a whole second game buried in there. It's a full-on old-school RPG. You pick a class (I went with Rogue, obviously), you can join guilds, fight mobs that have actual mechanics, craft gear, and they even have these server-wide World Boss events on the weekends. It feels like two completely different games\u2014an economic sim and a combat RPG\u2014running at the same time.\n\nThe admins are talking about how it's all going to eventually be a full Web3 project with NFTs and a real token, which sounds pretty ambitious. I feel like getting in early on something like this could be huge.\n\nSo I guess my question is, what do you guys think? Has anyone else seen this or played it? I can't decide if it's a hidden gem or just a huge time-sink with big promises.

I agreed and started to look into the issues but the more i saw about the project itself and overheard a phonecall with the woman who recruited him, i became more and more suspicious and i actually asked him about it and we began to talk about it and at quite an early point i had to admit that i was 99% sure that all of this was a scam and from there on we looked deeper and i also talked to that woman and after all of that i'm only even more convinced it's a scam. \n\nThe \"project\" is called \"Five Pillars Token\" and there are so many redflags imho... the numbers on CoinMarketCap do not add up, the whitepaper imho is not a whitepaper but just reads more like another marketing catalog.

What's interesting though is that the Board leader of the company \"Auvesta\" which is used for the rare metal investmens is being present at real life events of the team of this coin.

In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 18:40:56", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o0nbhz/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/", "coin": "BTC", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.12858519404572033}

She\u2019s a senior living in Los Angeles and recently retired. A few months ago, a *bank employee* at **BMO** convinced her to \u201cinvest in crypto for better returns.\u201d Since the employee worked at her bank, she completely trusted her.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened step-by-step:\n\n1. The employee helped her open an account on [**Crypto.com**](http://Crypto.com) and buy cryptocurrency (Ethereum) using her BMO bank funds.\n2. Then the employee told her to download **Trust Wallet** and \u201ctransfer her crypto there to earn more.\u201d\n3. The employee personally guided her through the setup \u2014 and we now suspect she either saw or kept a copy of the **12-word recovery phrase** (the wallet\u2019s private key).\n4. My aunt was also instructed to connect to a site via the \u201cDApps / Discover\u201d tab in Trust Wallet, supposedly for \u201cstaking\u201d or \u201cearning interest.\u201d\n5. After a while, the employee told her that her \u201cinvestment had grown\u201d and that to **claim her big returns**, she needed to **deposit more money first**. My aunt did this *twice*, believing she was just adding to her balance so she could withdraw more later.\n6. Shortly after her second deposit, **the funds disappeared** from her wallet.\n7. The employee then **quit her job** at BMO, and the bank told us they \u201ccan\u2019t do anything because she\u2019s no longer employed.\u201d\n\nThe worst part is that **my aunt did all of this secretly**, without telling anyone in the family. She truly thought she was investing wisely and surprising us later with good news. By the time we found out, it was too late.\n\nWe\u2019ve gathered:\n\n* Bank transaction records\n* [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) receipts and transfer logs\n* Trust Wallet transaction details\n* Screenshots and text messages between my aunt and the former employee\n\nThis was **her entire retirement savings**, and she\u2019s completely heartbroken.\n\nWe\u2019ve contacted BMO\u2019s fraud department, but they haven\u2019t been helpful so far. We\u2019re now preparing to report it to the **LAPD Financial Crimes Division**, **FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3.gov)**, and **Crypto.com\u2019s fraud team**.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Has anyone experienced something similar \u2014 especially scams involving *bank employees and crypto wallets*?\n* Is there any realistic way to trace or recover funds once they\u2019ve been drained from Trust Wallet?\n* Should we hire a lawyer \u2014 and if so, what kind? (Financial crimes, crypto fraud, or banking misconduct?)\n* How can we hold **BMO** accountable since their employee used her position to gain my aunt\u2019s trust and access her funds?\n\nWe\u2019d appreciate any advice or guidance. This has destroyed my aunt emotionally \u2014 this was her life savings, and she\u2019s been crying every day since it happened.\n\nThank you to anyone who can share insights or next steps.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 11:53:43", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o0cmfp/my_aunt_in_los_angeles_was_scammed_by_a_former/", "coin": "ETH", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.09065040650406504}

He was popular on the forums for a bit. He paid for ads there. \n\nFound two old exchanges I traded are that are bunk, C-Cex which is gone (scam phasing websites now replace them..). \n\nI had some amount of tips on ChangeTips that I couldn\u2019t access. \n\nI sent Riot games an email about how they should put background mining in the game as an opt in for free skins in 2013!! Like look at this\u2026 this is painful to read..\n\n> I would like to suggest that you create a feature that mines in the background of games on low power, on players computers. I am NOT suggesting that you do this \"secretly\". I'm suggesting that you could make a feature that you can turn on or off, and maybe compensates players with a little bonus RP or IP, or any other ideas you may have. Now, to talk numbers. I currently have a HP laptop with a basic Radeon graphics card, and I can mine at about 43 MHS (mega-hashes/second) at full power. So I could easily play league and mine at 0-5 MHS without noticing any performance difference. Now lets say you have 2 million players online at anytime, and 1 Million opt to have the mining in the background during a game on, averaging at 1 MHS (which is basically nothing by itself), But, with 1 million players running it, that would give you 1 Terra hash/second mining power, which at current price (bitcoin/usd) and difficulty is about 13-14,000 dollars a month in your pocket, and extra IP, RP, or whatever incentive you offer to the players in return.\n\n>Why am I suggesting this? Well there are three main reasons.\n1. As a part of the bitcoin community, I would like to see more exposure and more people learning about and using bitcoin, this would be a good opportunity for many people to learn about bitcoins and start using them.\n2. I would be okay with you using this idea with no personal compensation to me, although I would hope if you did implement it, you would give me some sort of personal gain, or allow me to work with your company on this system.\n3. As an avid player myself, I would enjoy the benefits of this system from a players perspective.\n\n>I'm just an 18 year old trying to make changes in the world, advocating for what I believe is a big part of the future. I am not with any company or anything, just a waiter at a local restaurant.\n\nI tried and sort of successfully set up a bitcoin faucet at some point, still trying to see if there\u2019s any scraps from that. I remember putting like $50 into the faucet. \n\nI found me pumping some shit coin on the Bitcoin talk threads. \n\nFound my eBay purchase of a USB miner for 17 bucks. I mined maybe $10 worth and flipped the miner back on eBay for $40ish. \n\n\n\nAll that goes to say that I basically have nothing left from it. I\u2019m proud of where crypto got but because of life I wasn\u2019t able to hold. It did help me get a car and a get my feet on the ground, but I completely missed the boat and am really struggling mentally with the day to day grind of life. Very nostalgic but also depressing.

We are currently witnessing the beginning of the end of the petrodollar era. What happens to the global monetary system when the US dollar loses its dominance and no credible successor emerges?\n\nThe world order is becoming multipolar economically, politically and technologically. This will also be reflected in monetary policy. In such a world, it is unlikely that a new national reserve currency, whether the euro, yuan, or a BRICS currency (LMAO) will simply replace the dollar\u2019s function. Much more likely is that Bitcoin will become the neutral, non-state reserve currency of a new era of a multipolar world.\n\nThe dollar is losing its position slowly but surely. US debt is over 35 trillion dollars and is growing exponentially. Monetary credibility is being undermined by aggressive quantitative easing policies. There is geopolitical use of the dollar payment system including sanctions and the weaponization of SWIFT. There are growing attempts at decoupling by BRICS, China, Russia, and ASEAN countries. The dollar will remain important for a long time but it is no longer unchallenged.\n\nWhy not simply use the yuan, euro, or a BRICS token?\n\nThe yuan has capital controls, lacks transparency and suffers from political unpredictability.\n\nThe euro suffers from fragmented fiscal policy, political disunity and lacks geopolitical projection.\n\nThe BRICS currency is ... come on, be serious lol\n\n\n\nAll of these fail at what once made the dollar strong, which is trust, liquidity and neutrality.\n\nBitcoin fulfills exactly this new role better than any national currency. Neutrality means that no government, corporation, or nation controls it. There are no sanctions, no printing presses, and no dependence on political moods. Bitcoin has a limited and credible supply of 21 million BTC, which is mathematically guaranteed. No trust is needed, only verification. Global access requires only an internet connection. States can trade bilaterally without clearing houses, SWIFT, or reserve currency dependency. Bitcoin\u2019s digital settlement infrastructure means it is natively digital. Scaling is possible via layer-2 solutions such as Lightning, sidechains, and programmable contracts. Interoperability with CBDCs and tokenization of real assets is also conceivable.\n\n\n\nA possible scenario is the establishment of a \u201cPetro-Bitcoin\u201d standard.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Russia, or Iran could sell their oil for BTC instead of the dollar. China or India could pay in BTC, bypassing dollar dependency. States could hold BTC in sovereign wealth funds or central bank vaults as protection against fiat depreciation. Multinational corporations could use BTC as a trade reserve currency.\n\nThus, a Bitcoin-based multilateral settlement system would gradually emerge that does not replace but supplements and ultimately displaces the existing system.\n\nCentral banks will hate it at first, then copy it, and finally integrate it. Bitcoin is to central banks what the internet was to governments. it is too disruptive to ignore and too powerful to ban.\n\nThe first signs are already visible.\n\nWe are at the beginning of monetary de-dollarization, and Bitcoin is the first neutral asset that is liquid, limited, global, immutable, and non-state-backed.\n\nNot despite but precisely because of its independence, Bitcoin is the natural asset for a new multipolar monetary order.\n\n\u201cBitcoin fixes this\u201d is not a meme", "created_utc": "2025-10-08 02:48:51", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o0z2yu/bitcoin_as_the_reserve_currency_of_a_multipolar/", "coin": "BTC", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.04842899036447423}

Some users have indicated they won\u2019t upgrade to the new release of Bitcoin\u2019s most-used client, or switched to running Bitcoin Knots: a software fork of Bitcoin Core maintained by OCEAN CTO Luke Dashjr, a vocal critic of the change.\n> \n> The debate is quite technical, about a seemingly minor issue. Bitcoin Core 30.0 will start to relay transactions across the network with bigger OP_RETURN outputs: transactions that embed arbitrary data (like text or images) in a specific way. This appears to be a minor change because Bitcoin Core (and Bitcoin Knots) nodes do already accept these transactions once they\u2019re included in a block, while they also relay transactions that store arbitrary data in other ways.\n> \n> But the update has caused a rift because it reflects deeper concerns.\n> \n> The \u201cBitcoin Knots perspective\u201d\n> \n> Bitcoin Knots proponents generally dislike that transactions can contain arbitrary data, or as they usually call it, \u201cspam\u201d. But so far, most have begrudgingly accepted this as an unfortunate side effect of the Bitcoin protocol.\n> \n> They do believe this type of usage should be discouraged, however. When Bitcoin Core developers did this in the past by imposing a limit on the size of OP_RETURN outputs that nodes relayed, it indeed appeared to make some people decide to take these kinds of use cases to other cryptocurrencies instead of Bitcoin. (Most notably, this is commonly explained as the \u201corigin story\u201d of Ethereum.)\n> \n> The updated relay policy in Bitcoin Core 30.0 in their view symbolizes the end of such resistance. It signals to \u201cspammers\u201d that they are welcome on Bitcoin.\n> \n> One concern is that this will increasingly draw in this class of users and projects. And because Bitcoin block space is limited, using it for data storage will fill blocks up quickly, in turn driving up transaction fees, perhaps to the point where many regular (\u201cmonetary\u201d) transactions are priced out because of it.\n> \n> Another concern is that, even though arbitrary data can already be embedded in different ways, OP_RETURN makes it a bit easier to parse this data compared to other methods; it takes a little less effort to turn it into (say) an image. This, Bitcoin Knots proponents worry, also increases the risk that inclusion of illicit materials like CSAM (child sexual abuse material) could result in regulatory pressure on node operators.\n> \n> If the problem is that Bitcoin Core developers are not resisting the spammers, Bitcoin Knots represents this resistance. Even if they can\u2019t prevent arbitrary data from being included in the Bitcoin blockchain, or not prevent it completely, they at least won\u2019t help open up an additional avenue for it. In effect, they\u2019d be signaling that spam is not welcome, which they hope will have a discouraging effect.\n> \n> Assuming this discouraging effect succeeds in keeping the spammers at bay, Bitcoin Knots proponents say, Bitcoin can continue to be used for what it was originally intended: monetary transactions.\n\nThis is putting things mildly and leaves out the extreme attack scenarios where this is exploited with malice. \n\n> \n> The \u201cBitcoin Core perspective\u201d\n> \n> People can store arbitrary data on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain in various ways. Indeed, in recent years many people stored images in Inscriptions, and it could even be embedded in public or private keys.\n> \n> Most Bitcoin Core developers do agree with Bitcoin Knots proponents that none of this is great, and it\u2019s not what Bitcoin is intended for. But out of all these options, using OP_RETURN is the least harmful method, because it minimizes a computer\u2019s resource consumption, thus keeping nodes as affordable and accessible as possible.\n> \n> As such, Bitcoin Core developers figure that rather than trying to resist the use of OP_RETURN, it\u2019s better to just allow it; limiting probably only makes matters worse, and possibly much worse.\n> \n> For one, just refusing to relay these transactions technically doesn\u2019t achieve much. These same transactions could still be relayed by some other nodes, like Libre Relay nodes, or they can be submitted to miners directly to be included in blocks. This in turn could have a centralizing effect, as direct submission would presumably be done to larger miners disproportionately, who then benefit from the extra fee revenue at the expense of smaller miners. (There are also some nuanced detriments for nodes themselves if such transactions do make it into a block anyways.)\n> \n> The more robust solution \u2014 and arguably the logical next step \u2014 is to render (big) OP_RETURN transactions invalid through a consensus protocol upgrade (soft fork), so they can\u2019t get mined at all. But the problem with that, as already noted, is that people might use other, more harmful methods to store data on the blockchain. (In fact, many already prefer to use Inscriptions because this is significantly cheaper for bigger chunks of data like images.)\n> \n> In theory, some of these methods could be blocked as well. But most Bitcoin Core developers foresee that this will only lead to a game of whack-a-mole, with \u201cspammers\u201d resorting to different methods each time. It would incentivize them to \u201cdisguise\u201d their data like regular transactions, which could lead to a situation where monetary transactions and arbitrary data become increasingly indistinguishable from each other.\n\nyes, that would be great, we want that.\n\n> \n> The only solution left in this stage might be to designate some person or group to make judgement calls about which transactions are acceptable and which are not, in effect introducing some kind of entity that has the power to impose censorship. \n\nthis is a retarded ass take. \n\n>Bitcoin Core developers (themselves a rather amorphous group of contributors) have no interest in taking on such a role \u2014 not least because they don\u2019t wish to become a target for regulators that could force them to abuse this power \u2014 and prefer Bitcoin not to go down this path at all.\n> \n\nalso, dumb. they're afraid of one end of a pointy stick while swallowing it's other end.\n\n> Instead, they generally expect that the problem will resolve itself over time, without their interference.\n\nwell, they are interfering by changing the op return limit default...\n\n> \n> This is because a monetary transaction is relatively speaking a tiny bit of data. A single Bitcoin block can fit thousands of them. Other types of data tend to be much larger; just one image can fill up an entire block. This means that a single \u201cspammer\u201d typically has to outbid many regular users. Given enough demand for monetary transactions, using Bitcoin for data storage quickly becomes expensive. Arbitrary data should in this scenario be priced out and disappear organically.\n> \n\nnot really the actual concern.\n\n> Most Bitcoin Core developers agree that Bitcoin should be a network primarily for monetary transactions\u2014 but not because they\u2019ll actively resist other use cases, rather because this is how the incentives of the system already align.\n> \n\nno one cares about their words, we care about their actions.\n\n> So now what?\n> \n> Everyone is free to use whatever software they want, whether this is Bitcoin Core 30.0 (with or without touching this default setting), an older version of Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Knots, Libre Relay, or anything else. In this sense Bitcoin users are, in a very real way, sovereign.\n\ndefaults are sticky. they matter.\n\n> \n> Judging by sentiments on social media platforms like X, it does seem that some non-trivial segment of users won\u2019t upgrade to Bitcoin Core 30.0, or indeed switch to Bitcoin Knots. But it\u2019s impossible to tell how big of a share of Bitcoin\u2019s user base this really represents. It could be a large majority\u2026 or it could be a small (and loud) minority.\n> \n> Either way, Bitcoin does not operate like a democracy. Because every node typically relays transactions to multiple others, if even a relatively small minority of users choose to run Bitcoin Core 30.0 (or Libre Relay or something similar), larger OP_RETURNs should in fact propagate rather freely. This probably can\u2019t be stopped completely, but assuming Bitcoin Knots proponents want to at least meaningfully stifle this, they\u2019ll need to convince some supermajority of node operators (perhaps 95% or more) to join them in their filtering efforts.\n> \n> If they fail to do that, running Bitcoin Knots can be seen as a voice of dissent\u2014 but one with little practical effect.\n\nnot impressed with the illogical regurgitations in this article.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 21:43:44", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o0s98g/some_thoughts_on_a_recent_article_by_aaron_van/", "coin": "BTC", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.03947055589912733}

And there was more threads but lots of them got removed by mods and I got \"kicked out\" from some subs as well, that's how much people were against this back then.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of posts lately from people asking about buying Bitcoin on credit. In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 18:16:38", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o0mmqr/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/", "coin": "BTC", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.12858519404572033}

The last time a setup like this happened was Bitcoin's 2018 recovery and this created years of growth as we all know.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uhvihm57motf1.jpg?width=2114&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc1e9811a137ddf617875afb10fe1609ac0cbe5d\n\nThe chart above is from GalaxyBTC's tweet and it also completes a huge triangle breakout pattern that has been in the making since 2021. Combined with rising institutional demand and steady on-chain activity this supports the idea that ETH is not done yet, only taking a break before the next leg up.\n\nPredictions are a little different. Some are $4,900, others $8,600 or higher but the overall sentiment online is that ETH is technically robust. If GalaxyBTC is right then this V-bottom could be the start of ETH's road to five figures.\n\n*Source:* [*https://x.com/galaxyBTC/status/1975060419594064147*](https://x.com/galaxyBTC/status/1975060419594064147)", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 12:19:42", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1o0d665/eths_chart_signals_a_bull_run_into_2026/", "coin": "BTC", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.07599523809523812}
{"id": "1o0bojq", "title": "DAT's - What are they good for? (onchain)", "selftext": "When i, in the start of July invested my hard earned money in a recently established ETH DAT, none of my money was onchain. In fact it had never been onchain and i had no plans for that to change. My investment was to get exposure to eth through the DAT, an asset i knew next to nothing about except: crypto=UP FAST + Blockchain good wow. That was about to change..\n\nSince 20% of my port now was exposed indirectly to ETH, i forced myself to atleast try to understand. And boy was i in for a ride.. \n\nWeekly updates on eth aquired, new partnerships with onchain players, Staking, stablecoins, TVL etc. All of it, i understood: NADA COMPENDRE!\n\nBut what it did, was something special, it opened my eyes. This asset i knew next to nothing about was not just \"the next Bitcoin moonshot go sky boom wow!\" like my apeminded naive retail investor brain thesis. It was an economy. I can still picture myself sitting in my 14 year old office chair with no wheels (fallen off from abuse), and reading about 'Staking'. \"This highly volatile crypto asset pays me interest from securing its network, and all i have to do is hold it in a staking form.. wow\" i remember thinking.\n\nMy Argument is very simple, altough alot of these DATS will eventually fail/fade out/pivot from their original strategy. One thing they have already suceeded in is: getting Retail Retards (Like yours truly), to be curious. And it shows, we almost hit an ath in monthly active addresses in august according to gemini 19.45 MILLION active addresses was recorded in the month of august 2025. Closest we've come to the ATH's of 2021 with 20 million+. I myself is a living example of this argument. \n\nMy hope for the future of the ETH + DAT relationships is that they will do more than just Aquire/Stake and further their relationships to important onchain partner. Of course in the short term pumping our bags is always neat, but for the long term getting people onchain using this beautiful ecosystem and realizing the use for it. Is what will bring us prosperity in the end. \n\nTLDR: DAT's Pump our bags, but most importantly bring awareness of the uses of ETH, i myself is a DAT RETARD RETAIL investor turned onchain obeyer.\n\nSincerely Fatkid13yrsold, former Retard Retailer turned Onchain Obeyer and Believer in somETHing.\n\n", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 11:06:44", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1o0bojq/dats_what_are_they_good_for_onchain/", "coin": "BTC", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.06192400192400191}

This is something that has not been seen in 30 years. Also on top of this the labor market outlook is getting weaker, deficit spending is well over $2 trillion annually and even jobs reports are on hold because of the government shutdown. And.. the Fed is not finished yet. Two more cuts are expected this year even as the U.S. is fighting against stagflation, slow growth mixed with high inflation. In the meantime tech giants are pouring over $100 billion every quarter into AI showing just how uneven the economy has become.\n\nWhat does this mean for us regular people?? Well the message is clear: hold assets or get left behind. Cash loses value when inflation stays sticky. Traditional bonds do not keep up when rates fall faster than prices. Assets that have independence from government policy, like ETH, stand out in this environment. As we all know well ETH is no longer just a speculative bet, it is increasingly being used as a reserve and settlement layer by institutions. If stagflation is here as it would seem then the old rule applies again: hard assets are the winner.. and for many more investors ETH is one of them.\n\nSource: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974092991842132271", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 10:39:01", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nzfipg/why_stagflation_and_fed_rate_cuts_point_toward/", "coin": "ETH", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.02591666666666667}

I appreciate that this is one of those danger danger type posts, but I\u2019ll go for it anyway.\n\nBack in the glory days of mining Ethereum I set up an official Ethereum Wallet. I sat on the mining proceeds for years and haven\u2019t touched them for over 8 years. Some years ago I went through the process of trying to consolidate assets, and found that the official Wallet is now not active, and hunting for a new wallet then took a back foot.\n\nI have all the required info to get access to the wallet etc, but nowadays most wallets don\u2019t accept older wallet transfers due to the old wallet\u2019s lack of secure \u2018security\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m basically looking to see if anyone else has or was in the same boat, and what you did.\n\nPlease don\u2019t spam about your dodgy looking wallet. I of course will be doing due diligence on any info I obtain here. \n\nI\u2019m struggling to hit the word limit here so apologies for the rambling and random additional comments. I just need to hit that glorious 200 word limit in order to post. I\u2019m sorry mods if I\u2019ve been disingenuous in getting round the limit and completely understand why it is in place (I am legitimately just looking for assistance).

The biggest chunk of that is Ethereum, sitting at about $830. My average buy-in was around $4,300, which obviously isn\u2019t great. I basically bought near the top without much strategy. That being said, I\u2019m trying to learn and figure out a better plan for the future.\n\nRight now I also hold some Solana and XRP as my other two main positions. Nothing crazy, but they\u2019re the coins I felt somewhat comfortable with at this stage. I also have a tiny meme bag just for fun, but ETH is by far the largest part of my portfolio.\n\nHere\u2019s my actual question: does it make sense to sell my ETH position towards the end of this year, November or December, and then try to buy back in during a potential correction or dip next year? Or is that just trying to time the market, which everyone says is a bad idea, and I should just hold what I\u2019ve got?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my plan for 2026 is to invest much more seriously into both BTC and ETH. This current portfolio is really just a starting point. I don\u2019t mind holding for years, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to reposition better if there\u2019s a dip coming.\n\nWould love to hear what more experienced traders and investors here would do in my situation. Thanks a lot in advance for your perspectives, I really appreciate the input.\n\nTL;DR: New to crypto, small $1.8k portfolio, most in ETH bought at $4.3k avg.

But as materkel.eth explained it on Twitter, that myth needs to die. What is true in 2025 is clear: it is faster, cheaper and smarter to deploy a Layer 2 on Ethereum than to create a brand-new L1.\n\nThe math should be self-explanatory, data across the Ethereum network shows L2 transactions costing between $0.01 and $0.10 while L1 fees stay higher. Besides that maintaining an independent L1 means constant work on validators, security and upgrades. L2 teams escape most of that and only work on their product and incentives, the things that are actually bringing in users. Community sentiment evolved too, instead of rival chains discussion now centers on Ethereum's 'superchain' model, where different interconnected L2's reinforce one another while still benefiting from the security of Ethereum. That shared trust layer keeps the whole network stronger, not weaker.\n\nGoing back to the tweet posted by materkel, his view is that any sane CTO will launch an L2. With speed, cost and product attention being the highest values in this world, building yet another L1 is not innovation.. it is distraction.\n\nSource: https://x.com/materkel/status/1973710778092970096", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 12:33:27", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwxv7p/launching_a_new_l1_today_is_like_starting_a_new/", "coin": "ETH", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14431818181818185}

In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 19:19:40", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o0oeaj/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/", "coin": "BTC", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.12858519404572033}

Investors appear to be rotating toward crypto amid broader uncertainty.\n\nThe rally coincided with Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high above $125,000.

Combined with its cash reserves, the total value of its assets now exceeds $530 million, surpassing the gross proceeds raised during its private placement in September.\n\nCosmo Jiang from Pantera Capital, who serves as a board observer, compared their approach to Michael Saylor\u2019s Bitcoin strategy at MicroStrategy and Tom Lee\u2019s model at Bitmine.

This indicates growing institutional interest in Solana as a treasury asset, not just from retail investors.\n\nSolana Company becomes one of the first publicly traded firms to hold SOL as a primary balance sheet asset, similar to how MicroStrategy uses Bitcoin and Bitmine uses Ethereum. When public companies hold crypto on their balance sheet, it creates consistent demand that is less tied to short term retail sentiment.\n\n2.2 million SOL represents a substantial portion of circulating supply being locked by a single entity, reducing available liquidity in the market. If more public companies follow this model, it could create steady buying pressure similar to Bitcoin\u2019s corporate treasury wave.\n\nWhether Solana Company\u2019s stock trades at a premium like MicroStrategy\u2019s remains to be seen, but this move marks an important moment for corporate adoption of Solana as a treasury asset.", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 20:09:15", "subreddit": "solana", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1nztv0l/nasdaqlisted_company_just_bought_22_million_sol/", "coin": "BTC", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.06973755411255411}

Instead of strict first-come-first-serve ordering, AMQs let apps batch transactions and decide their own execution rules.\u00a0\n\nThis model, called Application Controlled Execution (ACE), can give market makers more flexibility, reduce losses from sudden price jumps, and enable tighter spreads and better liquidity.\n\nAMQs divide program instructions into two types.\n\n1. **Synchronous instructions**\u00a0(such as deposits or withdrawals) that execute immediately.\n2. **Asynchronous instructions**\u00a0(such as cancels or limit orders) that are added to a priority queue.\n\nEach instruction is tagged with its slot and sequence number, then sorted according to application-defined rules. The queue is later processed after a short delay or when full, ensuring execution happens in priority order rather than simply by arrival time.\n\nSolana is uniquely positioned to support AMQs because programs can already queue and sort asynchronous instructions without requiring any protocol changes.\u00a0\n\nThis allows builders to experiment with new market models that would not be possible in traditional finance or on most other blockchains.\n\nFor DeFi builders, AMQs open the door to policy-aware sequencing, application-specific auctions, and more innovative execution mechanisms.\u00a0\n\n[**Application Controlled Execution (ACE) through Asynchronous Market Queues (AMQs)**](https://www.temporal.xyz/writings/application-controlled-execution-ace-through-asynchronous-market-queues-amqs?ref=blog.colosseum.com)\n\n# \ud83e\udd11 dApp Revenue Dominance\n\nSolana\u2019s dApp ecosystem continues to show strong revenue momentum with record highs and steady growth across categories.\u00a0\n\nAugust numbers show both record highs and steady growth across categories.\n\nKey highlights include:\n\n* **DePIN projects**\u00a0posted an all-time high of $1.6M in revenue, up 60% month-over-month, led by Helium, GEODNET, UpRock, and Hivemapper.\n* **DeFiTuna**\u00a0reached $422K, distributing 100% of revenue to stakers.\n* **Hylo**\u00a0set a new record with $238K in revenue, driven by its dual-token model and adaptive mint/redeem fees.\n* **Squads Protocol**\u00a0marked its eighth consecutive month of growth, reaching $35K from rising business subscriptions and multisig activity.\n* **Helium**\u00a0now routes subscription and usage revenue directly to onchain burns, boosting DePIN revenue sustainability.\n\nThese results highlight the depth and diversification of revenue across Solana\u2019s ecosystem.

The goal is to give developers direct, permissionless access to Bitcoin\u2019s $2T liquidity without relying on custodians, wrapped tokens, or fragmented L2 solutions.\n\nBitcoinKit leverages ZeusLayer to verify and tokenize BTC deposits in real time, creating zBTC, a token backed 1:1 by native Bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nOnce issued, zBTC can flow seamlessly into Solana DeFi protocols, where it behaves like any other onchain asset while retaining Bitcoin\u2019s underlying security guarantees.\n\nBitcoinKit is designed with a developer-first approach, offering multiple integration paths including widgets, agents, CLI tools, APIs, and full SDKs.\u00a0\n\nBitcoinKit debuts inside Jupnet (Jupiter\u2019s Omnichain Liquidity Network), enabling users to deposit and withdraw native BTC directly into Solana.\u00a0\n\nThis gives developers the ability to build Bitcoin-backed lending markets, BTC-stablecoin swaps,or\u00a0 yield products, all powered by Solana\u2019s high-throughput runtime.\n\n[**BitcoinKit: The Open Infrastructure Kit Unlocking Bitcoin's Programmable

aggregator, new interface, and a new Just in Time routing engine that can optimize a swap during transaction execution, not only before it.\n\nTraditional aggregators calculate routes offchain, locking them in before a transaction is executed, often leading to failed swaps or heavy slippage.\n\nDFlow\u2019s JIT Router solves this by checking market prices at the moment of execution.\u00a0\n\nIf conditions have shifted, it automatically reroutes to the best venue all within the same transaction.\n\nSwap instructions can branch dynamically, letting the router select the optimal liquidity source in real time so traders capture the best price on swaps.\u00a0\n\nDevelopers can leverage JIT Routing to offer users the best swaps in their own apps, focusing on product innovation while DFlow ensures trades settle efficiently under the hood.\n\n[**The DFlow JIT Router: Bringing Routing Intelligence

expands its Solana wallet into a full money app.\u00a0\n\nPowered by $CASH, a USD-pegged stablecoin issued via Bridge (Stripe\u2019s Open Issuance infrastructure), Phantom Cash lets users add money via bank or card directly in-app, buy/sell stablecoins with no fees, and spend anywhere Visa is accepted through Apple Pay, Google Pay, or a Phantom debit card.\n\nLaunching exclusively on Solana (initially), Phantom Cash signals the wallet\u2019s shift from a crypto-first product to a mainstream consumer payments app, giving its 15M monthly users an easy way to spend, send, and save with stablecoins.\n\nBuilders can integrate CASH into DeFi protocols, payments apps, and consumer products and a path to connect payments and stablecoin DeFi in one ecosystem.\n\n[**Introducing Phantom Cash: New Money, Now in Your Wallet**](https://www.phantom.com/learn/blog/introducing-phantom-cash?ref=blog.colosseum.com)\n\n# \ud83d\udc5b Wallet UI v2\n\nWallet UI v2 is a major update that makes

behavior\n* Separation of Gill SDK into its own package, allowing cleaner composition with any client\n* Improved stability and flexibility\n\nThis modular shift means devs can now plug Wallet UI into

He was popular on the forums for a bit. He paid for ads there. \n\nFound two old exchanges I traded are that are bunk, C-Cex which is gone (scam phasing websites now replace them..). \n\nI had some amount of tips on ChangeTips that I couldn\u2019t access. \n\nI sent Riot games an email about how they should put background mining in the game as an opt in for free skins in 2013!! Like look at this\u2026 this is painful to read..\n\n> I would like to suggest that you create a feature that mines in the background of games on low power, on players computers. I am NOT suggesting that you do this \"secretly\". I'm suggesting that you could make a feature that you can turn on or off, and maybe compensates players with a little bonus RP or IP, or any other ideas you may have. Now, to talk numbers. I currently have a HP laptop with a basic Radeon graphics card, and I can mine at about 43 MHS (mega-hashes/second) at full power. So I could easily play league and mine at 0-5 MHS without noticing any performance difference. Now lets say you have 2 million players online at anytime, and 1 Million opt to have the mining in the background during a game on, averaging at 1 MHS (which is basically nothing by itself), But, with 1 million players running it, that would give you 1 Terra hash/second mining power, which at current price (bitcoin/usd) and difficulty is about 13-14,000 dollars a month in your pocket, and extra IP, RP, or whatever incentive you offer to the players in return.\n\n>Why am I suggesting this? Well there are three main reasons.\n1. As a part of the bitcoin community, I would like to see more exposure and more people learning about and using bitcoin, this would be a good opportunity for many people to learn about bitcoins and start using them.\n2. I would be okay with you using this idea with no personal compensation to me, although I would hope if you did implement it, you would give me some sort of personal gain, or allow me to work with your company on this system.\n3. As an avid player myself, I would enjoy the benefits of this system from a players perspective.\n\n>I'm just an 18 year old trying to make changes in the world, advocating for what I believe is a big part of the future. I am not with any company or anything, just a waiter at a local restaurant.\n\nI tried and sort of successfully set up a bitcoin faucet at some point, still trying to see if there\u2019s any scraps from that. I remember putting like $50 into the faucet. \n\nI found me pumping some shit coin on the Bitcoin talk threads. \n\nFound my eBay purchase of a USB miner for 17 bucks. I mined maybe $10 worth and flipped the miner back on eBay for $40ish. \n\n\n\nAll that goes to say that I basically have nothing left from it. I\u2019m proud of where crypto got but because of life I wasn\u2019t able to hold. It did help me get a car and a get my feet on the ground, but I completely missed the boat and am really struggling mentally with the day to day grind of life. Very nostalgic but also depressing.

{"id": "1o0s90f", "title": "Deep Dive into non-BTC DATs", "selftext": "Everyone knows what MicroStrategy and Michael Saylor are doing with Bitcoin.  \nThe concept of a Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) has become one of the stronger narratives this cycle, with companies holding crypto directly on their balance sheets as a core strategy.\n\nWe all Bitcoin is king daddy of them all, but companies have been adding other alts to their balance sheet. As part of my mission to add more educational content to this sub, here are the companies that are accumulating other assets like ETH, SOL, or even meme tokens.\n\nAnd also, probably more importantly, the ones are doing it with real revenue and not just capital raises\n\n# ETH-Focused DATs\n\nMost Ethereum-based DATs fund their holdings through stock offerings, convertible debt, or token raises. After that, they rely on staking or restaking to generate yield and compound their positions.\n\nThis model increases balances but doesn\u2019t introduce new external capital into the asset. In other words, they\u2019re compounding what they already raised, not creating fresh demand.  \nOther holders are effectively diluted, not strengthened.\n\n* BitMine Immersion (BMNR) \u2013 Positions itself as an Ethereum treasury that earns staking yield and reinvests mining and operating revenue into more ETH accumulation.\n* ETHZilla (ETHZ) \u2013 Uses restaking and other ETH deployments, reinvesting part of those onchain yields into new ETH purchases.\n* SharpLink Gaming (SBET) \u2013 Tom Lee's company grows its ETH position through staking rewards while initial accumulation came from capital raises.\n\nIn all three cases, the \u201crevenue\u201d comes from the asset itself through staking rewards. These returns compound existing holdings but don\u2019t create new market demand for ETH.\n\n# SOL-Focused DATs\n\nIn the Solana ecosystem, Multicoin Capital is the closest analog to a DAT.  \nIts growth comes from venture capital inflows and early accumulation, with staking yield helping compound returns.\n\nLike Ethereum treasuries, it\u2019s an internal growth loop funded by investors, not business operations.  \nNo new external cash flow is entering SOL from real-world revenue.\n\n# The Other Guys\n\nSome companies have begun to hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but these are typically passive treasury strategies rather than active revenue-driven accumulation.\n\nFor example, Bit Origin has announced plans to build a Dogecoin treasury and is raising capital (equity and debt) to acquire DOGE. Other public companies hold DOGE as part of reserves, but there\u2019s no public evidence they are making ongoing purchases to increase those holdings like with see with MSTR.\n\nAs for LTC, MEI Pharma, Inc. (MEIP), a biotechnology company, purchased 929,548 LTC tokens in August 2025, using proceeds from a $100 million private placement to establish LTC as a core treasury asset.  They haven't made any subsequent purchases.\n\nDOGE and LTC treasuries show an interest in crypto assets being held by companies, but we haven't seen further accumulation like we've seen in BTC or larger alts.\n\n# Projects Buying-Back Their Token to Burn\n\nSome projects use revenue for buybacks and burns, but that\u2019s a very different dynamic.\n\nHyperliquid is the most notable and successful example, directing roughly 90 percent of its trading fees to buy back and burn its own token.\n\nThis creates onchain demand, but the purchases are internal to the protocol. There\u2019s no external business choosing to spend its revenue to accumulate the token, which to me is a bigger indication of belief in using digital assets as a treasury holding.\n\nBuyback-and-burn mechanisms help reduce supply, but they are not the same as a company with real-world income deciding to buy and hold tokens.\n\n# Businesses Using Revenue to Buy a Token\n\nAfter researching across different ecosystems, I could only find one company using revenue to buy a token. \n\nSafety Shot, initially a publicly traded beverage company, recently acquired a 10 percent revenue share in BONK.fun and an initial 25 million dollar position in BONK tokens. They added that they will reinvest roughly 90 percent of its revenue share into open-market BONK purchases, effectively tying its business success to the BONK ecosystem.\n\nThis is wild to me, as for many BONK is just a memecoin on Solana. However, BONK.fun, the BONK ecosystem\u2019s meme launchpad, already uses over 50% project revenue to buy back BONK and other top-performing tokens launched on its platform. \n\nI'd imagine Safety Shot saw BONK's revenue model and the platform pumping its token and saw an opportunity to get in early on the success. \n\nWhile we haven't seen TradFi companies do this with other buy-back-and-burn projects (Hyperliquid, deBridge, ApeX, etc), I think if Safety Shot has success it may be the blueprint.\n\n# tl;dr\n\n* BTC treasuries are the most common, but we are seeing other assets now being accumulated by TradFi\n* ETH and SOL treasuries grow primarily from staking yield on assets funded by earlier raises, compounding internally and diluting existing holders.\n* Some companies hold DOGE or LTC on their balance sheets, but they do so via capital deployment, not via business revenue.\n* Most altcoin DATs still rely on external funding or token sales to build their holdings.\n* BONK & Safety Shot is, so far, the only case I could find where a TradFi company is using its own revenue to actively buy a token on the open market.\n\nI expect over the next 1-2 years, we'll see an explosion of DATs across many different coins. Using revenue to buy tokens is a very interesting model, similar to stock buybacks.

It runs completely inside Discord.\n\nThe hook that got me was that you literally earn their in-game currency, called\u00a0`$TLR`, just by being active in chat or sitting in a voice channel. I figured that was it, just a simple little economy game.\n\nBut then I realized there's a whole second game buried in there. It's a full-on old-school RPG. You pick a class (I went with Rogue, obviously), you can join guilds, fight mobs that have actual mechanics, craft gear, and they even have these server-wide World Boss events on the weekends. It feels like two completely different games\u2014an economic sim and a combat RPG\u2014running at the same time.\n\nThe admins are talking about how it's all going to eventually be a full Web3 project with NFTs and a real token, which sounds pretty ambitious. I feel like getting in early on something like this could be huge.\n\nSo I guess my question is, what do you guys think? Has anyone else seen this or played it?

In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 18:40:56", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o0nbhz/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/", "coin": "BTC", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.12858519404572033}

She\u2019s a senior living in Los Angeles and recently retired. A few months ago, a *bank employee* at **BMO** convinced her to \u201cinvest in crypto for better returns.\u201d Since the employee worked at her bank, she completely trusted her.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened step-by-step:\n\n1. The employee helped her open an account on [**Crypto.com**](http://Crypto.com) and buy cryptocurrency (Ethereum) using her BMO bank funds.\n2. Then the employee told her to download **Trust Wallet** and \u201ctransfer her crypto there to earn more.\u201d\n3. The employee personally guided her through the setup \u2014 and we now suspect she either saw or kept a copy of the **12-word recovery phrase** (the wallet\u2019s private key).\n4. My aunt was also instructed to connect to a site via the \u201cDApps / Discover\u201d tab in Trust Wallet, supposedly for \u201cstaking\u201d or \u201cearning interest.\u201d\n5. After a while, the employee told her that her \u201cinvestment had grown\u201d and that to **claim her big returns**, she needed to **deposit more money first**. My aunt did this *twice*, believing she was just adding to her balance so she could withdraw more later.\n6. Shortly after her second deposit, **the funds disappeared** from her wallet.\n7. The employee then **quit her job** at BMO, and the bank told us they \u201ccan\u2019t do anything because she\u2019s no longer employed.\u201d\n\nThe worst part is that **my aunt did all of this secretly**, without telling anyone in the family. She truly thought she was investing wisely and surprising us later with good news. By the time we found out, it was too late.\n\nWe\u2019ve gathered:\n\n* Bank transaction records\n* [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) receipts and transfer logs\n* Trust Wallet transaction details\n* Screenshots and text messages between my aunt and the former employee\n\nThis was **her entire retirement savings**, and she\u2019s completely heartbroken.\n\nWe\u2019ve contacted BMO\u2019s fraud department, but they haven\u2019t been helpful so far. We\u2019re now preparing to report it to the **LAPD Financial Crimes Division**, **FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3.gov)**, and **Crypto.com\u2019s fraud team**.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Has anyone experienced something similar \u2014 especially scams involving *bank employees and crypto wallets*?\n* Is there any realistic way to trace or recover funds once they\u2019ve been drained from Trust Wallet?\n* Should we hire a lawyer \u2014 and if so, what kind? (Financial crimes, crypto fraud, or banking misconduct?)\n* How can we hold **BMO** accountable since their employee used her position to gain my aunt\u2019s trust and access her funds?\n\nWe\u2019d appreciate any advice or guidance. This has destroyed my aunt emotionally \u2014 this was her life savings, and she\u2019s been crying every day since it happened.\n\nThank you to anyone who can share insights or next steps.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 11:53:43", "subreddit": "CryptoCurrency", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o0cmfp/my_aunt_in_los_angeles_was_scammed_by_a_former/", "coin": "ETH", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.09065040650406504}

He was popular on the forums for a bit. He paid for ads there. \n\nFound two old exchanges I traded are that are bunk, C-Cex which is gone (scam phasing websites now replace them..). \n\nI had some amount of tips on ChangeTips that I couldn\u2019t access. \n\nI sent Riot games an email about how they should put background mining in the game as an opt in for free skins in 2013!! Like look at this\u2026 this is painful to read..\n\n> I would like to suggest that you create a feature that mines in the background of games on low power, on players computers. I am NOT suggesting that you do this \"secretly\". I'm suggesting that you could make a feature that you can turn on or off, and maybe compensates players with a little bonus RP or IP, or any other ideas you may have. Now, to talk numbers. I currently have a HP laptop with a basic Radeon graphics card, and I can mine at about 43 MHS (mega-hashes/second) at full power. So I could easily play league and mine at 0-5 MHS without noticing any performance difference. Now lets say you have 2 million players online at anytime, and 1 Million opt to have the mining in the background during a game on, averaging at 1 MHS (which is basically nothing by itself), But, with 1 million players running it, that would give you 1 Terra hash/second mining power, which at current price (bitcoin/usd) and difficulty is about 13-14,000 dollars a month in your pocket, and extra IP, RP, or whatever incentive you offer to the players in return.\n\n>Why am I suggesting this? Well there are three main reasons.\n1. As a part of the bitcoin community, I would like to see more exposure and more people learning about and using bitcoin, this would be a good opportunity for many people to learn about bitcoins and start using them.\n2. I would be okay with you using this idea with no personal compensation to me, although I would hope if you did implement it, you would give me some sort of personal gain, or allow me to work with your company on this system.\n3. As an avid player myself, I would enjoy the benefits of this system from a players perspective.\n\n>I'm just an 18 year old trying to make changes in the world, advocating for what I believe is a big part of the future. I am not with any company or anything, just a waiter at a local restaurant.\n\nI tried and sort of successfully set up a bitcoin faucet at some point, still trying to see if there\u2019s any scraps from that. I remember putting like $50 into the faucet. \n\nI found me pumping some shit coin on the Bitcoin talk threads. \n\nFound my eBay purchase of a USB miner for 17 bucks. I mined maybe $10 worth and flipped the miner back on eBay for $40ish. \n\n\n\nAll that goes to say that I basically have nothing left from it. I\u2019m proud of where crypto got but because of life I wasn\u2019t able to hold. It did help me get a car and a get my feet on the ground, but I completely missed the boat and am really struggling mentally with the day to day grind of life. Very nostalgic but also depressing.

We are currently witnessing the beginning of the end of the petrodollar era. What happens to the global monetary system when the US dollar loses its dominance and no credible successor emerges?\n\nThe world order is becoming multipolar economically, politically and technologically. This will also be reflected in monetary policy. In such a world, it is unlikely that a new national reserve currency, whether the euro, yuan, or a BRICS currency (LMAO) will simply replace the dollar\u2019s function. Much more likely is that Bitcoin will become the neutral, non-state reserve currency of a new era of a multipolar world.\n\nThe dollar is losing its position slowly but surely. US debt is over 35 trillion dollars and is growing exponentially. Monetary credibility is being undermined by aggressive quantitative easing policies. There is geopolitical use of the dollar payment system including sanctions and the weaponization of SWIFT. There are growing attempts at decoupling by BRICS, China, Russia, and ASEAN countries. The dollar will remain important for a long time but it is no longer unchallenged.\n\nWhy not simply use the yuan, euro, or a BRICS token?\n\nThe yuan has capital controls, lacks transparency and suffers from political unpredictability.\n\nThe euro suffers from fragmented fiscal policy, political disunity and lacks geopolitical projection.\n\nThe BRICS currency is ... come on, be serious lol\n\n\n\nAll of these fail at what once made the dollar strong, which is trust, liquidity and neutrality.\n\nBitcoin fulfills exactly this new role better than any national currency. Neutrality means that no government, corporation, or nation controls it. There are no sanctions, no printing presses, and no dependence on political moods. Bitcoin has a limited and credible supply of 21 million BTC, which is mathematically guaranteed. No trust is needed, only verification. Global access requires only an internet connection. States can trade bilaterally without clearing houses, SWIFT, or reserve currency dependency. Bitcoin\u2019s digital settlement infrastructure means it is natively digital. Scaling is possible via layer-2 solutions such as Lightning, sidechains, and programmable contracts. Interoperability with CBDCs and tokenization of real assets is also conceivable.\n\n\n\nA possible scenario is the establishment of a \u201cPetro-Bitcoin\u201d standard.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Russia, or Iran could sell their oil for BTC instead of the dollar. China or India could pay in BTC, bypassing dollar dependency. States could hold BTC in sovereign wealth funds or central bank vaults as protection against fiat depreciation. Multinational corporations could use BTC as a trade reserve currency.\n\nThus, a Bitcoin-based multilateral settlement system would gradually emerge that does not replace but supplements and ultimately displaces the existing system.\n\nCentral banks will hate it at first, then copy it, and finally integrate it. Bitcoin is to central banks what the internet was to governments. it is too disruptive to ignore and too powerful to ban.\n\nThe first signs are already visible.\n\nWe are at the beginning of monetary de-dollarization, and Bitcoin is the first neutral asset that is liquid, limited, global, immutable, and non-state-backed.\n\nNot despite but precisely because of its independence, Bitcoin is the natural asset for a new multipolar monetary order.\n\n\u201cBitcoin fixes this\u201d is not a meme", "created_utc": "2025-10-08 02:48:51", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o0z2yu/bitcoin_as_the_reserve_currency_of_a_multipolar/", "coin": "BTC", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.04842899036447423}

Some users have indicated they won\u2019t upgrade to the new release of Bitcoin\u2019s most-used client, or switched to running Bitcoin Knots: a software fork of Bitcoin Core maintained by OCEAN CTO Luke Dashjr, a vocal critic of the change.\n> \n> The debate is quite technical, about a seemingly minor issue. Bitcoin Core 30.0 will start to relay transactions across the network with bigger OP_RETURN outputs: transactions that embed arbitrary data (like text or images) in a specific way. This appears to be a minor change because Bitcoin Core (and Bitcoin Knots) nodes do already accept these transactions once they\u2019re included in a block, while they also relay transactions that store arbitrary data in other ways.\n> \n> But the update has caused a rift because it reflects deeper concerns.\n> \n> The \u201cBitcoin Knots perspective\u201d\n> \n> Bitcoin Knots proponents generally dislike that transactions can contain arbitrary data, or as they usually call it, \u201cspam\u201d. But so far, most have begrudgingly accepted this as an unfortunate side effect of the Bitcoin protocol.\n> \n> They do believe this type of usage should be discouraged, however. When Bitcoin Core developers did this in the past by imposing a limit on the size of OP_RETURN outputs that nodes relayed, it indeed appeared to make some people decide to take these kinds of use cases to other cryptocurrencies instead of Bitcoin. (Most notably, this is commonly explained as the \u201corigin story\u201d of Ethereum.)\n> \n> The updated relay policy in Bitcoin Core 30.0 in their view symbolizes the end of such resistance. It signals to \u201cspammers\u201d that they are welcome on Bitcoin.\n> \n> One concern is that this will increasingly draw in this class of users and projects. And because Bitcoin block space is limited, using it for data storage will fill blocks up quickly, in turn driving up transaction fees, perhaps to the point where many regular (\u201cmonetary\u201d) transactions are priced out because of it.\n> \n> Another concern is that, even though arbitrary data can already be embedded in different ways, OP_RETURN makes it a bit easier to parse this data compared to other methods; it takes a little less effort to turn it into (say) an image. This, Bitcoin Knots proponents worry, also increases the risk that inclusion of illicit materials like CSAM (child sexual abuse material) could result in regulatory pressure on node operators.\n> \n> If the problem is that Bitcoin Core developers are not resisting the spammers, Bitcoin Knots represents this resistance. Even if they can\u2019t prevent arbitrary data from being included in the Bitcoin blockchain, or not prevent it completely, they at least won\u2019t help open up an additional avenue for it. In effect, they\u2019d be signaling that spam is not welcome, which they hope will have a discouraging effect.\n> \n> Assuming this discouraging effect succeeds in keeping the spammers at bay, Bitcoin Knots proponents say, Bitcoin can continue to be used for what it was originally intended: monetary transactions.\n\nThis is putting things mildly and leaves out the extreme attack scenarios where this is exploited with malice. \n\n> \n> The \u201cBitcoin Core perspective\u201d\n> \n> People can store arbitrary data on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain in various ways. Indeed, in recent years many people stored images in Inscriptions, and it could even be embedded in public or private keys.\n> \n> Most Bitcoin Core developers do agree with Bitcoin Knots proponents that none of this is great, and it\u2019s not what Bitcoin is intended for. But out of all these options, using OP_RETURN is the least harmful method, because it minimizes a computer\u2019s resource consumption, thus keeping nodes as affordable and accessible as possible.\n> \n> As such, Bitcoin Core developers figure that rather than trying to resist the use of OP_RETURN, it\u2019s better to just allow it; limiting probably only makes matters worse, and possibly much worse.\n> \n> For one, just refusing to relay these transactions technically doesn\u2019t achieve much. These same transactions could still be relayed by some other nodes, like Libre Relay nodes, or they can be submitted to miners directly to be included in blocks. This in turn could have a centralizing effect, as direct submission would presumably be done to larger miners disproportionately, who then benefit from the extra fee revenue at the expense of smaller miners. (There are also some nuanced detriments for nodes themselves if such transactions do make it into a block anyways.)\n> \n> The more robust solution \u2014 and arguably the logical next step \u2014 is to render (big) OP_RETURN transactions invalid through a consensus protocol upgrade (soft fork), so they can\u2019t get mined at all. But the problem with that, as already noted, is that people might use other, more harmful methods to store data on the blockchain. (In fact, many already prefer to use Inscriptions because this is significantly cheaper for bigger chunks of data like images.)\n> \n> In theory, some of these methods could be blocked as well. But most Bitcoin Core developers foresee that this will only lead to a game of whack-a-mole, with \u201cspammers\u201d resorting to different methods each time. It would incentivize them to \u201cdisguise\u201d their data like regular transactions, which could lead to a situation where monetary transactions and arbitrary data become increasingly indistinguishable from each other.\n\nyes, that would be great, we want that.\n\n> \n> The only solution left in this stage might be to designate some person or group to make judgement calls about which transactions are acceptable and which are not, in effect introducing some kind of entity that has the power to impose censorship. \n\nthis is a retarded ass take. \n\n>Bitcoin Core developers (themselves a rather amorphous group of contributors) have no interest in taking on such a role \u2014 not least because they don\u2019t wish to become a target for regulators that could force them to abuse this power \u2014 and prefer Bitcoin not to go down this path at all.\n> \n\nalso, dumb. they're afraid of one end of a pointy stick while swallowing it's other end.\n\n> Instead, they generally expect that the problem will resolve itself over time, without their interference.\n\nwell, they are interfering by changing the op return limit default...\n\n> \n> This is because a monetary transaction is relatively speaking a tiny bit of data. A single Bitcoin block can fit thousands of them. Other types of data tend to be much larger; just one image can fill up an entire block. This means that a single \u201cspammer\u201d typically has to outbid many regular users. Given enough demand for monetary transactions, using Bitcoin for data storage quickly becomes expensive. Arbitrary data should in this scenario be priced out and disappear organically.\n> \n\nnot really the actual concern.\n\n> Most Bitcoin Core developers agree that Bitcoin should be a network primarily for monetary transactions\u2014 but not because they\u2019ll actively resist other use cases, rather because this is how the incentives of the system already align.\n> \n\nno one cares about their words, we care about their actions.\n\n> So now what?\n> \n> Everyone is free to use whatever software they want, whether this is Bitcoin Core 30.0 (with or without touching this default setting), an older version of Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Knots, Libre Relay, or anything else. In this sense Bitcoin users are, in a very real way, sovereign.\n\ndefaults are sticky. they matter.\n\n> \n> Judging by sentiments on social media platforms like X, it does seem that some non-trivial segment of users won\u2019t upgrade to Bitcoin Core 30.0, or indeed switch to Bitcoin Knots. But it\u2019s impossible to tell how big of a share of Bitcoin\u2019s user base this really represents. It could be a large majority\u2026 or it could be a small (and loud) minority.\n> \n> Either way, Bitcoin does not operate like a democracy. Because every node typically relays transactions to multiple others, if even a relatively small minority of users choose to run Bitcoin Core 30.0 (or Libre Relay or something similar), larger OP_RETURNs should in fact propagate rather freely. This probably can\u2019t be stopped completely, but assuming Bitcoin Knots proponents want to at least meaningfully stifle this, they\u2019ll need to convince some supermajority of node operators (perhaps 95% or more) to join them in their filtering efforts.\n> \n> If they fail to do that, running Bitcoin Knots can be seen as a voice of dissent\u2014 but one with little practical effect.\n\nnot impressed with the illogical regurgitations in this article.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 21:43:44", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o0s98g/some_thoughts_on_a_recent_article_by_aaron_van/", "coin": "BTC", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.03947055589912733}

And there was more threads but lots of them got removed by mods and I got \"kicked out\" from some subs as well, that's how much people were against this back then.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of posts lately from people asking about buying Bitcoin on credit. In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 18:16:38", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o0mmqr/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/", "coin": "BTC", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.12858519404572033}

Other technical analysts are also seeing the same phenomenon. A confirmed V-bottom setup has a high success rate with 70-80% chances of long-term bullish reversals. The last time a setup like this happened was Bitcoin's 2018 recovery and this created years of growth as we all know.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uhvihm57motf1.jpg?width=2114&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc1e9811a137ddf617875afb10fe1609ac0cbe5d\n\nThe chart above is from GalaxyBTC's tweet and it also completes a huge triangle breakout pattern that has been in the making since 2021. Combined with rising institutional demand and steady on-chain activity this supports the idea that ETH is not done yet, only taking a break before the next leg up.\n\nPredictions are a little different. Some are $4,900, others $8,600 or higher but the overall sentiment online is that ETH is technically robust. If GalaxyBTC is right then this V-bottom could be the start of ETH's road to five figures.\n\n*Source:* [*https://x.com/galaxyBTC/status/1975060419594064147*](https://x.com/galaxyBTC/status/1975060419594064147)", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 12:19:42", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1o0d665/eths_chart_signals_a_bull_run_into_2026/", "coin": "BTC", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.07599523809523812}
{"id": "1o0bojq", "title": "DAT's - What are they good for? (onchain)", "selftext": "When i, in the start of July invested my hard earned money in a recently established ETH DAT, none of my money was onchain. In fact it had never been onchain and i had no plans for that to change. My investment was to get exposure to eth through the DAT, an asset i knew next to nothing about except: crypto=UP FAST + Blockchain good wow. That was about to change..\n\nSince 20% of my port now was exposed indirectly to ETH, i forced myself to atleast try to understand. And boy was i in for a ride.. \n\nWeekly updates on eth aquired, new partnerships with onchain players, Staking, stablecoins, TVL etc. All of it, i understood: NADA COMPENDRE!\n\nBut what it did, was something special, it opened my eyes. This asset i knew next to nothing about was not just \"the next Bitcoin moonshot go sky boom wow!\" like my apeminded naive retail investor brain thesis. It was an economy. I can still picture myself sitting in my 14 year old office chair with no wheels (fallen off from abuse), and reading about 'Staking'. \"This highly volatile crypto asset pays me interest from securing its network, and all i have to do is hold it in a staking form.. wow\" i remember thinking.\n\nMy Argument is very simple, altough alot of these DATS will eventually fail/fade out/pivot from their original strategy. One thing they have already suceeded in is: getting Retail Retards (Like yours truly), to be curious. And it shows, we almost hit an ath in monthly active addresses in august according to gemini 19.45 MILLION active addresses was recorded in the month of august 2025. Closest we've come to the ATH's of 2021 with 20 million+. I myself is a living example of this argument. \n\nMy hope for the future of the ETH + DAT relationships is that they will do more than just Aquire/Stake and further their relationships to important onchain partner. Of course in the short term pumping our bags is always neat, but for the long term getting people onchain using this beautiful ecosystem and realizing the use for it. Is what will bring us prosperity in the end. \n\nTLDR: DAT's Pump our bags, but most importantly bring awareness of the uses of ETH, i myself is a DAT RETARD RETAIL investor turned onchain obeyer.\n\nSincerely Fatkid13yrsold, former Retard Retailer turned Onchain Obeyer and Believer in somETHing.\n\n", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 11:06:44", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1o0bojq/dats_what_are_they_good_for_onchain/", "coin": "BTC", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.06192400192400191}

This is something that has not been seen in 30 years. Also on top of this the labor market outlook is getting weaker, deficit spending is well over $2 trillion annually and even jobs reports are on hold because of the government shutdown. And.. the Fed is not finished yet. Two more cuts are expected this year even as the U.S. is fighting against stagflation, slow growth mixed with high inflation. In the meantime tech giants are pouring over $100 billion every quarter into AI showing just how uneven the economy has become.\n\nWhat does this mean for us regular people?? Well the message is clear: hold assets or get left behind. Cash loses value when inflation stays sticky. Traditional bonds do not keep up when rates fall faster than prices. Assets that have independence from government policy, like ETH, stand out in this environment. As we all know well ETH is no longer just a speculative bet, it is increasingly being used as a reserve and settlement layer by institutions. If stagflation is here as it would seem then the old rule applies again: hard assets are the winner.. and for many more investors ETH is one of them.\n\nSource: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974092991842132271", "created_utc": "2025-10-06 10:39:01", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nzfipg/why_stagflation_and_fed_rate_cuts_point_toward/", "coin": "ETH", "sentiment": "neutral", "polarity": 0.02591666666666667}

I appreciate that this is one of those danger danger type posts, but I\u2019ll go for it anyway.\n\nBack in the glory days of mining Ethereum I set up an official Ethereum Wallet. I sat on the mining proceeds for years and haven\u2019t touched them for over 8 years. Some years ago I went through the process of trying to consolidate assets, and found that the official Wallet is now not active, and hunting for a new wallet then took a back foot.\n\nI have all the required info to get access to the wallet etc, but nowadays most wallets don\u2019t accept older wallet transfers due to the old wallet\u2019s lack of secure \u2018security\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m basically looking to see if anyone else has or was in the same boat, and what you did.\n\nPlease don\u2019t spam about your dodgy looking wallet. I of course will be doing due diligence on any info I obtain here. \n\nI\u2019m struggling to hit the word limit here so apologies for the rambling and random additional comments. I just need to hit that glorious 200 word limit in order to post. I\u2019m sorry mods if I\u2019ve been disingenuous in getting round the limit and completely understand why it is in place (I am legitimately just looking for assistance).

The biggest chunk of that is Ethereum, sitting at about $830. My average buy-in was around $4,300, which obviously isn\u2019t great. I basically bought near the top without much strategy. That being said, I\u2019m trying to learn and figure out a better plan for the future.\n\nRight now I also hold some Solana and XRP as my other two main positions. Nothing crazy, but they\u2019re the coins I felt somewhat comfortable with at this stage. I also have a tiny meme bag just for fun, but ETH is by far the largest part of my portfolio.\n\nHere\u2019s my actual question: does it make sense to sell my ETH position towards the end of this year, November or December, and then try to buy back in during a potential correction or dip next year? Or is that just trying to time the market, which everyone says is a bad idea, and I should just hold what I\u2019ve got?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m even considering this is because my plan for 2026 is to invest much more seriously into both BTC and ETH. This current portfolio is really just a starting point. I don\u2019t mind holding for years, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to reposition better if there\u2019s a dip coming.\n\nWould love to hear what more experienced traders and investors here would do in my situation. Thanks a lot in advance for your perspectives, I really appreciate the input.\n\nTL;DR: New to crypto, small $1.8k portfolio, most in ETH bought at $4.3k avg.

But as materkel.eth explained it on Twitter, that myth needs to die. What is true in 2025 is clear: it is faster, cheaper and smarter to deploy a Layer 2 on Ethereum than to create a brand-new L1.\n\nThe math should be self-explanatory, data across the Ethereum network shows L2 transactions costing between $0.01 and $0.10 while L1 fees stay higher. Besides that maintaining an independent L1 means constant work on validators, security and upgrades. L2 teams escape most of that and only work on their product and incentives, the things that are actually bringing in users. Community sentiment evolved too, instead of rival chains discussion now centers on Ethereum's 'superchain' model, where different interconnected L2's reinforce one another while still benefiting from the security of Ethereum. That shared trust layer keeps the whole network stronger, not weaker.\n\nGoing back to the tweet posted by materkel, his view is that any sane CTO will launch an L2. With speed, cost and product attention being the highest values in this world, building yet another L1 is not innovation.. it is distraction.\n\nSource: https://x.com/materkel/status/1973710778092970096", "created_utc": "2025-10-03 12:33:27", "subreddit": "ethtrader", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1nwxv7p/launching_a_new_l1_today_is_like_starting_a_new/", "coin": "ETH", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.14431818181818185}

In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.", "created_utc": "2025-10-07 19:19:40", "subreddit": "CryptoMarkets", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o0oeaj/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/", "coin": "BTC", "sentiment": "positive", "polarity": 0.12858519404572033}

Investors appear to be rotating toward crypto amid broader uncertainty.\n\nThe rally coincided with Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high above $125,000.

Instead of strict first-come-first-serve ordering, AMQs let apps batch transactions and decide their own execution rules.\u00a0\n\nThis model, called Application Controlled Execution (ACE), can give market makers more flexibility, reduce losses from sudden price jumps, and enable tighter spreads and better liquidity.\n\nAMQs divide program instructions into two types.\n\n1. **Synchronous instructions**\u00a0(such as deposits or withdrawals) that execute immediately.\n2. **Asynchronous instructions**\u00a0(such as cancels or limit orders) that are added to a priority queue.\n\nEach instruction is tagged with its slot and sequence number, then sorted according to application-defined rules. The queue is later processed after a short delay or when full, ensuring execution happens in priority order rather than simply by arrival time.\n\nSolana is uniquely positioned to support AMQs because programs can already queue and sort asynchronous instructions without requiring any protocol changes.\u00a0\n\nThis allows builders to experiment with new market models that would not be possible in traditional finance or on most other blockchains.\n\nFor DeFi builders, AMQs open the door to policy-aware sequencing, application-specific auctions, and more innovative execution mechanisms.\u00a0\n\n[**Application Controlled Execution (ACE) through Asynchronous Market Queues (AMQs)**](https://www.temporal.xyz/writings/application-controlled-execution-ace-through-asynchronous-market-queues-amqs?ref=blog.colosseum.com)\n\n# \ud83e\udd11 dApp Revenue Dominance\n\nSolana\u2019s dApp ecosystem continues to show strong revenue momentum with record highs and steady growth across categories.\u00a0\n\nAugust numbers show both record highs and steady growth across categories.\n\nKey highlights include:\n\n* **DePIN projects**\u00a0posted an all-time high of $1.6M in revenue, up 60% month-over-month, led by Helium, GEODNET, UpRock, and Hivemapper.\n* **DeFiTuna**\u00a0reached $422K, distributing 100% of revenue to stakers.\n* **Hylo**\u00a0set a new record with $238K in revenue, driven by its dual-token model and adaptive mint/redeem fees.\n* **Squads Protocol**\u00a0marked its eighth consecutive month of growth, reaching $35K from rising business subscriptions and multisig activity.\n* **Helium**\u00a0now routes subscription and usage revenue directly to onchain burns, boosting DePIN revenue sustainability.\n\nThese results highlight the depth and diversification of revenue across Solana\u2019s ecosystem.

The goal is to give developers direct, permissionless access to Bitcoin\u2019s $2T liquidity without relying on custodians, wrapped tokens, or fragmented L2 solutions.\n\nBitcoinKit leverages ZeusLayer to verify and tokenize BTC deposits in real time, creating zBTC, a token backed 1:1 by native Bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nOnce issued, zBTC can flow seamlessly into Solana DeFi protocols, where it behaves like any other onchain asset while retaining Bitcoin\u2019s underlying security guarantees.\n\nBitcoinKit is designed with a developer-first approach, offering multiple integration paths including widgets, agents, CLI tools, APIs, and full SDKs.\u00a0\n\nBitcoinKit debuts inside Jupnet (Jupiter\u2019s Omnichain Liquidity Network), enabling users to deposit and withdraw native BTC directly into Solana.\u00a0\n\nThis gives developers the ability to build Bitcoin-backed lending markets, BTC-stablecoin swaps,or\u00a0 yield products, all powered by Solana\u2019s high-throughput runtime.\n\n[**BitcoinKit: The Open Infrastructure Kit Unlocking Bitcoin's Programmable

aggregator, new interface, and a new Just in Time routing engine that can optimize a swap during transaction execution, not only before it.\n\nTraditional aggregators calculate routes offchain, locking them in before a transaction is executed, often leading to failed swaps or heavy slippage.\n\nDFlow\u2019s JIT Router solves this by checking market prices at the moment of execution.\u00a0\n\nIf conditions have shifted, it automatically reroutes to the best venue all within the same transaction.\n\nSwap instructions can branch dynamically, letting the router select the optimal liquidity source in real time so traders capture the best price on swaps.\u00a0\n\nDevelopers can leverage JIT Routing to offer users the best swaps in their own apps, focusing on product innovation while DFlow ensures trades settle efficiently under the hood.\n\n[**The DFlow JIT Router: Bringing Routing Intelligence

expands its Solana wallet into a full money app.\u00a0\n\nPowered by $CASH, a USD-pegged stablecoin issued via Bridge (Stripe\u2019s Open Issuance infrastructure), Phantom Cash lets users add money via bank or card directly in-app, buy/sell stablecoins with no fees, and spend anywhere Visa is accepted through Apple Pay, Google Pay, or a Phantom debit card.\n\nLaunching exclusively on Solana (initially), Phantom Cash signals the wallet\u2019s shift from a crypto-first product to a mainstream consumer payments app, giving its 15M monthly users an easy way to spend, send, and save with stablecoins.\n\nBuilders can integrate CASH into DeFi protocols, payments apps, and consumer products and a path to connect payments and stablecoin DeFi in one ecosystem.\n\n[**Introducing Phantom Cash: New Money, Now in Your Wallet**](https://www.phantom.com/learn/blog/introducing-phantom-cash?ref=blog.colosseum.com)\n\n# \ud83d\udc5b Wallet UI v2\n\nWallet UI v2 is a major update that makes the developer toolkit leaner, and more reliable.\u00a0\n\nThe release includes:\n\n* Comprehensive new docs with examples\n* Fixes for functional and logical errors that broke apps or caused odd behavior\n* Separation of Gill SDK into its own package, allowing cleaner composition with any client\n* Improved stability and flexibility\n\nThis modular shift means devs can now plug Wallet UI into

That number isn\u2019t *wrong*\u2014it just describes **policy minting**, not the **growth of tradable (circulating) supply** that markets actually feel. In this article, we will take a look at theese two sides of the same coin and explain the differences.\n\n# 1) What the official inflation rate is\n\nSolana\u2019s protocol sets an **annual inflation parameter** and mints new SOL proportionally over time, distributing it to the staked set (validators + delegators). Conceptually:\n\n* `r_annual` \u2014 protocol\u2019s annual inflation parameter (decimal, e.g., 0.07 for 7%)\n* `S_start` \u2014 total SOL supply at the start of a period\n* `\u0394t` \u2014 length of the epoch (seconds)\n* `Y` \u2014 seconds per year (e.g., 31,536,000)\n\n**Exact time-proportional mint for one epoch**\n\n    Mint_epoch = S_start * ( (1 + r_annual)^(\u0394t / Y) - 1 )\n\nAnnualizing across many epochs reproduces the **official** or **policy inflation**. That figure answers:\n\n>\n\n**Important:** This is about **minted supply** by design. It does **not** attempt to measure the market float.\n\n[Solana\u2019s official inflation rate.

Unlocks and treasury moves matter here.\n\nLet:\n\n* `Circ_T0`, `Circ_T1` \u2014 circulating supply at start/end\n* `Unlocks` \u2014 previously non-circulating SOL that entered circulation\n* `Relocks` \u2014 SOL that left circulation (vesting/escrow/treasury moves)\n* `Treasury_Moves` \u2014 any policy-relevant reclassifications affecting float (foundation spending, grants, etc.)\n\nObserved change:\n\n    \u0394Circ_observed = Circ_T1 - Circ_T0\n\nYou can decompose it (optional, for clarity):\n\n    \u0394Circ_observed = (Real_Issuance - Burns_effect_on_circulating) + Unlocks - Relocks + Treasury_Moves\n\nThen the float inflation rate:\n\n    CircInfl_window = \u0394Circ_observed / Circ_T0\n    CircInfl_annualized = (1 + CircInfl_window)^( Seconds_per_year / Seconds_in_window ) - 1\n\n**Key distinction:** Unlocks and treasury distributions **do not mint** new SOL; they change **who can sell it**, so they affect **circulating**, not **total** supply.\n\n[Market inflation rate from https:\\/\\/www.cryptoinflation.eu\\/coin\\/solana](https://preview.redd.it/wqjclvyk1atf1.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&s=359dd24cbe18fcb583f1f71f5aa7eadad070e333)\n\n# 4) Reconciling the perspectives\n\n* **Official (policy) inflation**: what the protocol intends to mint per year.\n* **Circulating inflation**: how the tradable float changed after unlocks/treasury activity and burns.\n\n# Bottom line\n\nThe **official Solana inflation rate isn\u2019t wrong**\u2014it\u2019s just a **policy measure of minting**.
